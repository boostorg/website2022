Vesa Karvonen
=============

![-](vesa_karvonen.jpg) If
 we are to believe MBTI tests, Vesa is an [INTJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTJ).
 He has been like that probably since late 1978-1979, because,
 according to some sources, it takes 2-3 years to develop the
 basic temperament. Previously he saw himself mostly as a
 "builder of systems" and "applier of theoretical models", but
 nowadays he is beginning to see the "mastermind" aspect of his
 personality. As a "Free-Thinker", his mind hardly ever
 rests.


Vesa enjoys healthy and sustainable ways of life. He is a
 vegetarian and likes cooking. Exercise is a daily part of his
 life - he needs to be in good shape in order to sit all day in
 work. He likes going to the gym, swimming, spinning, running,
 roller skating, etc... He also practices dancing.


For the past years, he has been working in a small [company](http://www.housemarque.com) that
 develops console games. His role is the development of software
 technology, such as class libraries, frameworks and tools, for
 making games. He doesn't see himself as a game or a graphics
 programmer, although he has been involved in quite a few such
 projects. For the past few years, most of his programming has
 been in C++, but recently he has also enjoyed writing some
 Ocaml.


He likes buying technical books using the company credit
 card, but lately he hasn't had the time to read as much as he
 would like (hopefully this changes soon). He likes reading (a
 lot) computer science and software engineering, but also
 psychology, philosophy and various self-help books, because he
 knows that all the really hard problems are social - not
 technical. Fantasy is also close to his heart.


Vesa is a bit ambivalent about his university studies. He is
 a self-educated programmer and has experience ranging from bit
 twiddling to generative programming and also leading of small
 teams. Like many of his close colleagues, he sees that the
 depth of computer science education, at least in Finland, is,
 frankly, insufficient. He'll probably complete his studies some
 day, because sadly most people respect authority by rank, title
 or publication far more than he does.


Vesa is an eXtreme Programmer. He has found out that in
 order for pair programming to work, both pairs must share a
 similar level of experience and must be both willing and able
 to externalize their thoughts. If he is sometimes forced to
 stop refactoring, he'll probably quit his job. He thinks that
 optimization, including improving readability and simplifying
 structure, is the root of all fun in programming. He dislikes
 writing documentation and reports that are never read.


One of his friends coerced him to use the image that you see
 on this page. The image was scanned from a rather worn out
 picture taken by an ex-girlfriend and is probably the only
 picture of Vesa having his natural smile. Vesa is neither
 married nor engaged, but just recently he met a very nice
 girl... While programming is interesting and fun, it is love
 that really makes him happy. ;)
