### Important
 - New Toolset Names
 The names of some the Boost.Build [toolsets](/doc/libs/1_32_0/more/getting_started.html#Tools)
 have been changed to remove the "." (dot) character
 and to fix some other naming inconsistencies. For example, vc7.1
 toolset was renamed to become vc-7\_1. Please refer to the
 [Supported Toolsets](/doc/libs/1_32_0/more/getting_started.html#Tools)
 section of the installation guide for the complete list of the current toolset
 names. This change was made as a part of the effort to make the Boost distribution
 compatible with ISO 9660 level 2 requirements.
 

### New Libraries

 new infrastructure for generic algorithms that builds on top of the new
 iterator concepts, from Thorsten Ottosen.
* [Serialization
 Library](/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/serialization/doc/index.html): Serialization/de-serialization of arbitrary C++ data structures
 to various formats including text, binary, and xml, from Robert Ramey.
* [String

### Updated Libraries


* Compose: This deprecated library has been removed.
* [Graph](/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/graph/index.html):

	+ Added [bundled
	 properties](/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/graph/doc/bundles.html) to the [`adjacency\_list`](/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/graph/doc/adjacency_list.html) and [`adjacency\_matrix`](/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/graph/doc/adjacency_matrix.html) class
	 templates, greatly simplifying the introduction of internal vertex
	 and edge properties.
	+ The [LEDA
	 graph adaptors](/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/graph/doc/leda_conversion.html) have been ported to LEDA 4.5.
	+ Added algorithms for [betweenness
	 centrality](/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/graph/doc/betweenness_centrality.html) and [betweenness
	 centrality clustering](/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/graph/doc/bc_clustering.html).
	+ Added [circle
	 layout](/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/graph/doc/circle_layout.html) and [undirected
	 spring layout](/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/graph/doc/kamada_kawai_spring_layout.html) algorithms.
* [MPL Library](/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/mpl/doc/index.html):

	+ Updated to use the Boost Software License.
	+ New [documentation](/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/mpl/doc/index.html),
	 including a complete [reference
	 manual.](/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/mpl/doc/refmanual.html)
	+ Major interface changes and improvements, many of which are not backward
	 compatible. Please refer to the [1.32
	 changelog](/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/mpl/doc/tutorial/changes-in-boost-1-32-0.html) for the detailed information about upgrading to
	 the new version.
* [Python
 Library](/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/python/doc/index.html):

	+ Updated to use the Boost Software License.
	+ a new, [better
	 method of wrapping classes with virtual functions](/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/python/doc/tutorial/doc/html/python/exposing.html#python.class_virtual_functions) has been
	 implemented.
	+ Support for the new Python Bool type, thanks to Daniel Holth.
	+ Support for upcoming GCC symbol export control features have been
	 folded in, thanks to Niall Douglas.
	+ Improved support for `std::auto\_ptr`-like
	 types.
	+ Components used by other libraries have been moved out of python/detail
	 and into boost/detail to improve dependency relationships.
	+ Miscellaneous bug fixes and compiler workarounds.
* [Signals Library](/doc/libs/1_32_0/doc/html/signals.html): Introduced
 deterministic slot ordering, permitting slots to be connected at the beginning
 or end of slot groups or the slot list itself. Combiners may safely have
 state and are accessible from the signal.
* [Utility](/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/utility/utility.htm): class
 template [result\_of](/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/utility/utility.htm#result_of)
 added.
* [Test Library](/doc/libs/1_32_0/libs/test/index.html):

	+ namespace names gets shorten; old one still supported till next
	 release
	+ added proper encoding of XML PCDATA
	+ support for wide string comparison implemented

### Regression tests
 This release has been extensively tested on a variety of different compilers
 and platforms. It is known to contain no regressions against the previous reference
 release on the compilers and configurations tested. Please refer to the corresponding
 [regression
 reports](http://www.meta-comm.com/engineering/boost-regression/1_32_0/index.html) to see how well your compiler performs on the new Boost codebase.
 

### Acknowledgements

 Gurtovoy](/users/people/aleksey_gurtovoy.html) managed this release. [Managing
 a release](/doc/libs/1_32_0/more/release_procedures.htm) at all is an enormous job, and Aleksey always goes beyond
 merely meeting requirements by insisting on the highest possible quality. The
 Boost membership owes him a debt of gratitude.
 
 This release wouldn't have been possible without the dedicated effort of many,
 many members of the Boost community who generously contributed their outstanding
 expertise, time and energy to making it happen. For patches, bug fixes, troubleshooting,
 expert advice, and prompt responses to the release manager's requests we thank:

 Also, our special thanks go to: John Maddock for the managing the effort of
 converting the majority of the Boost libraries to the [Boost
 Software License](/doc/libs/1_32_0/more/license_info.html), Eric Niebler and Joel de Guzman for taking on the
 important job of improving the Boost documentation's look and feel, and last,
 but not least, to our regression test runners, without whom we simply would
 never have released: Toon Knapen, Bronek Kozicki, Rene Rivera, Markus Schopflin,
