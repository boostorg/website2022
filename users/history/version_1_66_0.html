### Third Party Downloads


* [Windows Binaries](https://boostorg.jfrog.io/artifactory/main/release/1.66.0/binaries/)


### Note about
 the new Visual Studio release
 Visual Studio 15.5 was released too late for us to test this release with it.
 

### New Libraries


* [Beast](/libs/beast/):
 Portable HTTP, WebSocket,
 and network operations using only C++11 and Boost.Asio, from Vinnie Falco.
* [CallableTraits](/libs/callable_traits/):
 A spiritual
 successor to Boost.FunctionTypes, Boost.CallableTraits is a header-only
 C++11 library for the compile-time inspection and manipulation of all 'callable'
 types. Additional support for C++17 features, from Barrett Adair.
* [Mp11](/libs/mp11/):
 A C++11 metaprogramming library,
 from Peter Dimov.

### Updated Libraries


* [Asio](/libs/asio/):

	+ Implemented interface changes to reflect the Networking TS ([N4656](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4656.pdf)).
	 
		- See the [list](/doc/libs/1_66_0/doc/html/boost_asio/net_ts.html)
		 of new interfaces and, where applicable, the corresponding
		 old interfaces that have been superseded.
		- The service template parameters, and the corresponding classes,
		 are disabled by default. For example, instead of `basic\_socket<Protocol,
		SocketService>`
		 we now have simply `basic\_socket<Protocol>`. The old interface can
		 be enabled by defining the `BOOST\_ASIO\_ENABLE\_OLD\_SERVICES`
		 macro.
	+ Removed previously deprecated functions.
	+ Added support for customised handler tracking.
	+ Added reactor-related (i.e. descriptor readiness) events to handler
	 tracking.
	+ Added special "concurrency hint" values that may be used
	 to disable locking on a per `io\_context`
	 basis.
	+ Enabled perfect forwarding for the first `ssl::stream<>` constructor argument.
	+ Added ability to release ownership of the underlying native socket.
	 (Requires Windows 8.1 or later when using the I/O completion port
	 backend.)
* [Atomic](/libs/atomic/):

	+ Implemented a set of experimental extended atomic operations for
	 integral types:
	 
		- `fetch\_negate`,
		 `fetch\_complement`
		 - atomically replaces the value with a negated or binary complemented
		 value and returns the original value
		- `opaque\_<op>`
		 - equivalent to `fetch\_<op>` except that it doesn't
		 return the original value
		- `<op>\_and\_test`
		 - atomically applies `<op>`
		 and returns `true`
		 if the result is zero. **Note:**
		 The result of these operations will change to the opposite
		 in Boost 1.67. The code that uses these functions will need
		 to be updated.
		- `bit\_test\_and\_set`,
		 `bit\_test\_and\_reset`,
		 `bit\_test\_and\_complement`
		 - atomically sets, resets or complements the specified bit
		 and returns the original value of the bit
	+ Following C++17 ([P0558R1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0558r1.pdf)),
	 arithmetic operations for pointers to non-object types are no longer
	 provided.
	+ Also following C++17 exposed `atomic<T>::value\_type`
	 and `atomic<T>::difference\_type` member typedefs,
	 where applicable, to the user's code.
	+ Improved compatibility with gcc 7. In particular, using 128-bit operations
	 on x86-64 should no longer require linking with libatomic (the compiler-supplied
	 library).
* [DateTime](/libs/date_time/):

	+ The library has been converted to use Boost.WinAPI as the abstraction
	 layer for Windows SDK.
	+ Fixed an integral overflow that could cause incorrect results when
	 adding or subtracting many years from a date (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45537280/boost-datetime-issue-with-adding-long-year-durations)).
* [Fiber](/libs/fiber/):

	+ synchronization with CUDA streams
	+ synchronization with ROCm/HIP streams
* [Format](/libs/format/):

	+ Improvements:
	 
		- Accept new conversion specifiers:
		 
			* [`a`](https://github.com/boostorg/format/pull/41): sets flags
			 `fixed | scientific`
			 (i.e. `hexfloat`)
			* [`b`](https://github.com/boostorg/format/pull/43): sets flag
			 `boolalpha`
			* [`A`](https://github.com/boostorg/format/pull/41): same as
			 `a` plus
			 flag `uppercase`
			* [`F`](https://github.com/boostorg/format/pull/41): same as
			 `f` plus
			 flag `uppercase`
		- [42](https://github.com/boostorg/format/pull/42)
		 Accept new argument types `j`
		 and `z` from
		 ISO C99 (parsed and ignored like all others).
		- [44](https://github.com/boostorg/format/pull/44)
		 Accept new argument types `I`,
		 `I32`, `I64`, and `w`
		 from Microsoft (parsed and ignored like all others).
		- [33](https://github.com/boostorg/format/issues/33)
		 Added a development tool called `format\_matrix`
		 that exercises as many different combinations of format strings
		 as possible and logs them to a file:
		 
			* helps prevent regressions in between boost releases
			* allows for comparison against `snprintf`
	+ Bugfixes:
	 
		- [36](https://github.com/boostorg/format/issues/36)
		 Safely allow volatile arguments to be used with operator%
		- [4636](https://svn.boost.org/trac10/ticket/4636)
		 Explicit clamping provided to allow MSVC /RTCc to succeed
		- [7477](https://svn.boost.org/trac10/ticket/7477)
		 Fix compatibility with MSVC /Za
		- [10324](https://svn.boost.org/trac10/ticket/10324)
		 Const-correct cast issue resolved
		- [11632](https://svn.boost.org/trac10/ticket/11632)
		 Fix `-fsanitize=undefined`
		 issue in `alt\_sstream.hpp`
* [Fusion](/libs/fusion/):

	+ [PR#149](https://github.com/boostorg/fusion/pull/149)
	`isspace(c)`
	 is not a macro in Dinkum clib for VxWorks, thanks to Brian Kuhl(@kuhlenough).
	+ [PR#150](https://github.com/boostorg/fusion/pull/150)
	 Remove circular preprocessor include, thanks to Gregor Jasny(@gjasny).
	+ [PR#151](https://github.com/boostorg/fusion/pull/151)
	 Change base of `fusion::tuple`.
	+ [PR#153](https://github.com/boostorg/fusion/pull/153)
	 Fixed compile error with `std::array`.
	+ [PR#154](https://github.com/boostorg/fusion/pull/154)
	 Fixed bugs nesting and copying on c++03.
* [Geometry](/libs/geometry/):

	+ Improvements:
	 
		- Add distance for geographic PointLike/AnyGeometry.
	+ Bugfixes:
	 
		- Fixes in results of union/intersection/difference which could
		 be incorrect in very complex cases
		- Fixes in validity of union/intersection/difference/buffer
		- Fixes in set and relational operations for non-cartesian coordinate
		 systems.
* [Iterator](/libs/iterator/):

	+ `next()`/`prior()`
	 functions now support user's iterators that don't specify nested
	 types such as `iterator\_category`,
	 `difference\_type`,
	 etc. and instead specialize `std::iterator\_traits`
	 to define those types. The compiler must support C++17-compatible
	 `std::iterator\_traits` for this to work.
* [Log](/libs/log/):

	+ Bug fixes:
	 
		- Fixed a bug in `file\_collector::scan\_for\_files`
		 that could cause incorrectly named log files in the target
		 directory after the user's application restart.
	+ See [changelog](/libs/log/doc/html/log/changelog.html)
	 for more details.
* [Math](/libs/math/):

	+ New Features:
	 
		- Add Gauss and Gauss-Kronrod quadrature routines.
		- Add double-exponential (tanh-sinh, exp-sinh and sinh-sinh)
		 quadrature routines.
		- Add Chebyshev polynomial evaluation, roots, integration, differentiation,
		 and interpolation routines.
* [Multi-index Containers](/libs/multi_index/index.html):

	+ Made `modify` and
	 `modify\_key` more robust
	 so that the modified element is erased if the modifier throws or
	 the rollback functor does not properly restore the element (full
	 discussion at ticket [#12542](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/12542)). This is technically backwards
	 incompatible; for instance, the following code:
	 
	
	```
	c.modify(c.begin(),[](auto&){throw 0;});
	
	```
	
	
	 keeps the container `c`
	 untouched in former versions of Boost whereas now `c.begin()` is erased. Thanks to Jon Kalb for
	 raising the issue.
	+ Maintenance fixes.
* [Optional](/libs/optional/index.html):

	+ On newer compilers `optional`
	 is now trivially-copyable for scalar `T`s.
	 This uses a different storage (just `T`
	 rather than `aligned\_storage`).
	 We require the compiler to support defaulted functions.
	+ Changed the implementation of `operator==` to get rid of the `-Wmaybe-uninitialized`
	 false-positive warning from GCC.
* [PolyCollection](/libs/poly_collection/):

	+ Boost.PolyCollection has been backported to GCC 4.8 to 4.9 and Clang
	 3.3 to 3.6. The version of libstdc++-v3 shipped with GCC 4.8 (which
	 can also be used by Clang) has deficiencies that result in the following
	 limitations when using Boost.PolyCollection:
	 
		- Stateful allocators are not properly supported.
		- Allocator-extended move construction decays to allocator-extended
		 copy construction.
		- Copy construction crashes if an exception is thrown during
		 element copying.
	+ Maintenance fixes.
* [Predef](/libs/predef/):

	+ Improved Windows Universal Platform detection. (from James E. King,
	 III)
	+ Add detection for CloudABI with cloudlibc. (from James E. King, III)
	+ Various other bug fixes.
* [Regex](/libs/regex/):

	+ Bug fixes:
	 
		- Numerous small fixes for security issues discovered by de-fuzzing.
* [Stacktrace](/libs/stacktrace/):

	+ Now works out-of-the-box on MinGW-w64.
	+ Now works on MinGW (without `-w64`) if `libbacktrace`
	 is properly installed. See "MinGW specific notes" section
	 in documentation for more info.
* [Thread](/libs/thread/):

	+ Bugs Fixes

* [Utility](/libs/utility/):

	+ `boost/next\_prior.hpp` has been moved to Boost.Iterator.
	 No changes needed to the user's code.
* [Uuid](/libs/uuid/):

	+ Improvements:
	 
		- [26](https://github.com/boostorg/uuid/issues/26)
		 Refactored `name\_generator`
		 to support a configurable hash provider concept and provide
		 an optional MD5 hash implementation per RFC-4122. This will
		 make it easier to support whatever becomes the next standard
		 hash algorithm.
		- [34](https://github.com/boostorg/uuid/issues/34)
		 Added RFC-4122 namespaces in `boost::uuids::ns`.
	+ Bugfixes:
	 
		- [8630](https://svn.boost.org/trac10/ticket/8630)
		[11482](https://svn.boost.org/trac10/ticket/11482)

		 were resolved.
		- [10665](https://svn.boost.org/trac10/ticket/10665)
		`name\_generator::operator()` is now const, matching docs.
		- Detail headers were moved into the detail subdirectory. No
		 changes needed to user's code, however you may get build warnings
		 if you use the old header location.
* [Variant](/libs/variant/):

	+ `boost::apply\_visitor` now does perfect
	 forwarding of visitables [#6971](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6971). Great thanks to Levon Tarakchyan
	 for implementing this feature.
