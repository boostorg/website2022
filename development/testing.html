Regression Tests
----------------


A group of volunteers donate CPU cycles and large amounts of
 disk space to collectively produce the regression testing
 result tables. Various Boost repository versions are tested for
 the benefit of library developers and interested users:

| Version | Developers |
| --- | --- |
| Develop branch | [Summary](tests/develop/developer/summary.html) | [Unresolved
 Issues](tests/develop/developer/issues.html) |
| Master branch | [Summary](tests/master/developer/summary.html) | [Unresolved
 Issues](tests/master/developer/issues.html) |


Snapshots
---------


Snapshots are used for quality control checks.  The
 Unix tarballs and Windows zipballs are identical except for the
 line endings exported from Git.


Because the snapshots represent work-in-process, they may
 not be suitable for production use.

Inspection
 Reports
-------------------


The Boost snapshots are inspected daily to detect problems
 such as missing copyrights or licenses. The Boost Inspection
 Report tells all!

More about
 regression tests
----------------------------


Will all Boost libraries work with your compiler? 
 Unfortunately, the answer is "it depends". See the [regression testing results](#RegressionTesting) to see
 exactly what works and what doesn't.


Boost libraries rely on modern C++ features such as
 templates and the C++ Standard Library.  Most modern
 compilers support those major features fairly well. But even
 today, years after the adoption of the C++ Standard, some
 compilers still don't support important minor features like
 partial template specialization.


Boost library authors often expend a great deal of effort
 trying to work around compiler deficiencies. 
 Nevertheless, some libraries will not compile at all with
 certain compilers or may have crippled functionality. 
 Even if the current release of a compiler supports a boost
 library, older versions of the compiler may not work
 properly.


Boost releases are run through regression tests which
 automatically generates compiler status tables for various
 platforms. Unless otherwise indicated, the C++ Standard Library
 implementation is the one shipped with the compiler.


### Warnings:


* These tables are not a good indication of a particular
 compiler's compliance with the C++ Standard.  The Boost
 libraries often contain workarounds which mask compiler
 deficiencies.
* Some regression tests are run only occasionally, and so
 are relatively out-of-date.  Check the date and revision
 in the column heading.


The development code is being updated several times a day,
 so it may contain bug fixes, compiler workarounds, new
 features, and even whole new libraries. It may be unstable,
 however.
