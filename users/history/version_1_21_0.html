Version 1.21.0
--------------


March 9th, 2001 12:00 GMT

* [Iterator Adaptor
 Library](/libs/utility/iterator_adaptors.htm) added. Adapt a base type into a standard conforming iterator,
 and more, from Dave Abrahams, Jeremy Siek, and John Potter.
* [Pool Library](/libs/pool/doc/index.html) added.
 Memory pool management from Steve Cleary.
* [Test Library](/libs/test/doc/index.html) added.
 Support for program testing and execution from Beman Dawes.
* [Generic Programming Techniques](/more/generic_programming.html)
 page added, contributed by Dave Abrahams.
* [Graph Library](/libs/graph/doc/table_of_contents.html):
 Updated
 use of iterator adaptors. Changed `operator
==` for `adjacency\_list::edge\_descriptor`
 to improve semantics for multigraphs. Moved `adjacency\_iterator\_generator`
 from namespace `detail` to
 `boost` and added [documentation](/libs/graph/doc/adjacency_iterator.html).
 Renamed `dynamic\_components()` to [`incremental\_components()`](/libs/graph/doc/incremental_components.html),
 better matching graph literature terminology. Cleaned up interface of [`connected\_components()`](/libs/graph/doc/connected_components.html) and created separate [`strong\_components()`](/libs/graph/doc/strong_components.html)
 function using Tarjan's more efficient algorithm. Fixed documentation figures
 for [`adjacency\_list`](/libs/graph/doc/adjacency_list.html)
 and [`adjacency\_matrix`](/libs/graph/doc/adjacency_matrix.html).
 Added docs for [`cuthill\_mckee\_ordering()`](/libs/graph/doc/cuthill_mckee_ordering.html)
 algorithm.
* [Python Library](/libs/python/doc/index.html) upgraded.
 Better compatibility with Python 2.0, NULL pointers and smart-pointers get
 converted to/from python None, massive documentation review/revision.
* [Regular Expression Library](/libs/regex/index.html): Minor
 fixes for Unicode platforms.
* [Type Traits Library](/libs/type_traits/index.html)
 upgraded:
 Major revision.
