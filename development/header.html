Boost Header policy



Boost Header policy
===================

Header files are the place where a library comes into
 contact with user code and other libraries. To co-exist
 peacefully and productively, headers must be "good
 neighbors".


Here are the standards for boost headers. Many of these are
 also reasonable guidelines for general use.


* Header filenames should have a .hpp (lowercase)
 extension.
* Unless multiple inclusion is intended, wrap the header in
 #ifndef guards. Use a naming convention that minimizes the
 chance of clashes with macro names from other's code. The
 [sample header](#SampleHeader) uses the Boost
 convention of all uppercase letters, with the header name
 prefixed by the namespace name, and suffixed with HPP,
 separated by underscores.
* Wrap the header contents in a namespace to prevent global
 namespace pollution. The namespace approach to pollution
 control is strongly preferred to older approaches such as
 adding funny prefixes to global names. Libraries which are
 designed to work well with other Boost libraries should be
 placed in namespace boost.
* Make sure that a translation unit consisting of just the
 contents of the header file will compile successfully.
* Place the header file in a sub-directory to prevent
 conflict with identically named header files in other
 libraries. The parent directory is added to the compiler's
 include search path. Then both your code and user code
 specifies the sub-directory in #include directives.
 Thus the header [sample header](#SampleHeader)
 would be included by #include
 <boost/furball.hpp>. (Note, including from current
 file directory using #include "furball.hpp" syntax
 is discouraged .)
* The preferred ordering for class definitions is public
 members, protected members, and finally private members.
* Include the boost/config.hpp [configuration
 header](/doc/libs/release/libs/config/config.htm) if there is a need to deal with compiler or
 platform configuration issues.


Sample
 Header
--------------
```

//  Boost general library furball.hpp header file ---------------------------//

  < *html) >

//  See https://www.boost.org/ for latest version.

#ifndef BOOST\_FURBALL\_HPP
#define BOOST\_FURBALL\_HPP

namespace boost {

//  Furball class declaration  -----------------------------------------------//

  class furball
  {
    public: 
      void throw\_up();
    private:
      int whatever;
  };  // furball

} // namespace

#endif  // include guard

```

Coding Style
------------


The alert reader will have noticed that the [sample header](#SampleHeader) employs a certain coding
 style for indentation, positioning braces, commenting ending
 braces, and similar formatting issues. These stylistic issues
 are viewed as personal preferences and are not part of the
 Boost Header Policy.
