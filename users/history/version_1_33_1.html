### Updated Libraries


* [Any Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/doc/html/any.html): Cast
 to reference types introduced in 1.33.0 is now documented on `any\_cast` documentation page.
* [Bind Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/bind/bind.html): Bind
 expressions now support [comparisons
 and negation](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/bind/bind.html#operators). Example: `bind(&X::name, \_1) < bind(&X::name, \_2)`.
* [Config Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/config/index.html): Don't
 undef `BOOST\_LIB\_TOOLSET`
 after use.
* [Boost.Python](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/python/doc/index.html):

	+ The build now assumes Python 2.4 by default, rather than 2.2
	+ Support Python that's built without Unicode support
	+ Support for wrapping classes with overloaded address-of (`&`) operators
* [Smart Pointer
 Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/smart_ptr/index.html): Fixed problems under Metrowerks CodeWarrior on PowerPC
 (Mac OS X) with inlining on, GNU GCC on PowerPC 64.
* [Regex Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/regex/doc/index.html): Fixed
 the supplied makefiles, and other small compiler specific changes. Refer
 to the [regex
 history page](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/regex/doc/history.html) for more information on these and other small changes.
* [Iostreams
 Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/iostreams/doc/index.html):
 Improved the interface for accessing a chain's components,
 added `is\_open` members to
 the file and file descriptor devices, fixed memory-mapped files on Windows,
 and made minor changes to the documentation.
* [Boost.Python](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/python/doc/index.html):

	+ Added support for docstrings on nonstatic properties.
	+ We now export the client-provided docstrings for `init<optional<> >`
	 and *XXX*`\_FUNCTION\_OVERLOADS()` for only the last overload.
	+ Support for Embedded VC++ 4 and GCC-3.3 on MacOS added
	+ Introduced better support for rvalue from-python conversions of shared\_ptr.
	+ Support for exposing `vector<T\*>` with the indexing suite.
	+ updated visual studio project build file.
	+ Added search feature to the index page.
* [Functional/Hash
 Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/functional/hash/index.html):
 Fixed the points example.
* [Multi-index
 Containers Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/multi_index/doc/index.html):
 Fixed a problem with multithreaded code, and
 other minor changes. Refer to the library [release
 notes](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/multi_index/doc/release_notes.html#boost_1_33_1) for further details.
* [Graph
 Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/graph/doc/table_of_contents.html):

	+ Fixed a problem with the relaxed heap on x86 Linux (fixes bug in
	 `dijkstra\_shortest\_paths`).
	+ Fixed problems with [`cuthill\_mckee\_ordering`](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/graph/doc/cuthill_mckee_ordering.html)
	 and [`king\_ordering`](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/graph/doc/king_ordering.html) producing
	 no results.
	+ Added `color\_map` parameter
	 to `dijkstra\_shortest\_paths`.
* [Signals
 Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/signals/doc/index.html): Fixed problems with the use of Signals across shared library
 boundaries.
* [Thread
 library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/thread/doc/index.html):
`read\_write\_mutex`
 has been removed due to problems with deadlocks.
* [Wave library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/wave/index.html)
 (V1.2.1): Fixed a couple of problems, refer to the [change
 log](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/wave/ChangeLog) for further details.

### Supported Compilers
 Boost is tested on a wide range of compilers and platforms. Since Boost libraries
 rely on modern C++ features not available in all compilers, not all Boost libraries
 will work with every compiler. The following compilers and platforms have been
 extensively tested with Boost, although many other compilers and platforms
 will work as well. For more information, see the [regression
 test results](https://www.boost.org/regression/release/user/).
 
*New for this release*: Support for building with the newest
 STLport-5.0 was added. The support includes building with MinGW Runtime 3.8
 plus STLport-5.0 improved to support wide character operations. Apple GCC 4.0,
 HP Tru64 C++, and Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0 are supported platforms. We have
 added an experimental autoconf-like configure script for
 Unix-like systems: run configure --help for more information.
 


* [Apple GCC](http://developer.apple.com/) 3.3, 4.0 on
 Mac OS X.
* [Borland C++](http://www.codegear.com/products/cppbuilder)
 5.6.4 on Windows.
* [GNU C++](http://gcc.gnu.org) 2.95.3 (with and without
 STLport), 3.2.x., 3.3.x, 3.4.x, 4.0.x on Windows, Linux and Solaris.
* [HP C++ for Tru64 UNIX 7.1](http://h30097.www3.hp.com/cplus/).
* [Intel
 C++](http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/compilers/index.htm) 8.1, 9.0 on Windows, Linux.
* [Metrowerks CodeWarrior](http://www.metrowerks.com) 8.3,
 9.4, 9.5 on Mac OS X and Windows.
* [Microsoft Visual C++](http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/)
 6.0 (sp5, with and without STLport), 7.0, 7.1, 8.0. Note: Boost does not
 support the non-standard "Safe" C++ Library shipping with Visual
 C++ 8.0, which may result in many spurious warnings from Boost headers
 and other standards-conforming C++ code. To suppress these warnings, define
 the macro `\_SCL\_SECURE\_NO\_DEPRECATE`.
