### New Libraries


* [STLInterfaces](/libs/stl_interfaces/): A library
 of CRTP bases to ease the writing of STL views, iterators, and sequence
 containers, from Zach Laine.

### Updated Libraries


* [Asio](/libs/asio/):

	+ Added an implementation of the proposed standard executors ([P0443r13](http://wg21.link/P0443r13), [P1348r0](http://wg21.link/P1348r0),
	 and [P1393r0](http://wg21.link/P1393r0)).
	+ Added support for the proposed standard executors to Asio's I/O facilities.
	 
		- The supplied executors now meet the requirements for the proposed
		 standard executors. These classes also continue to meet the
		 existing requirements for the Networking TS model of executors.
		- All I/O objects, asynchronous operations, and utilities will
		 interoperate with both new proposed standard executors, and
		 with existing Networking TS executors.
		- The `any\_io\_executor`
		 type alias has been introduced as the default runtime-polymorphic
		 executor for all I/O objects. This defaults to the `execution::any\_executor<>`
		 template. If required for backward compatibility, `BOOST\_ASIO\_USE\_TS\_EXECUTOR\_AS\_DEFAULT`
		 can be defined to use the old `asio::executor`
		 polymorphic wrapper instead.
		- Support for the existing Networking TS model of executors can
		 be disabled by defining `BOOST\_ASIO\_NO\_TS\_EXECUTORS`.
	+ Added converting move construction and assignment to `basic\_waitable\_timer`.
	+ Enabled C++20 coroutine support when using gcc
	 10.
	+ Added overloads of `co\_spawn`
	 that launch an awaitable.
	+ Added a new constructor overload to `use\_awaitable\_t`'s
	 default executor adapter, to enable conversion between executor types.
	+ Added support for using `detached\_t`
	 as a default completion token, by adding members `as\_default\_on()` and `as\_default\_on\_t<>`.
	+ Added a move constructor to `ssl::stream<>`.
	+ Changed `ssl::stream<>`
	 write operations to linearise gather-write buffer sequences.
	+ Added compile-time detection of the deprecated `asio\_handler\_invoke`,
	 `asio\_handler\_allocate`,
	 and `asio\_handler\_deallocate`
	 hooks, when `BOOST\_ASIO\_NO\_DEPRECATED`
	 is defined.
	+ Implemented a number of performance optimisations.
	+ Added source location support to handler tracking.
	+ Implemented various improvements to the handlerviz.pl
	 tool.
	+ Added the handlerlive.pl tool, which processes
	 handler tracking output to produce a list of "live" handlers.
	+ Added the handlertree.pl tool, which filters handler
	 tracking output to include only those events in the tree that produced
	 the nominated handlers.
	+ Added changes for clang-based Embarcadero C++ compilers.
	+ Fixed a deadlock that can occur when multiple threads concurrently
	 initialise the Windows I/O completion port backend.
	+ Fixed `async\_compose`
	 to work with copyable handlers when passed by lvalue.
	+ Fixed completion signature deduction in `co\_spawn`.
	+ Removed a spurious `Executor`
	 base class from the `executor\_binder`
	 implementation.
	+ Various fixes and improvements in the documentation and examples.
	+ Consult the [Revision
	 History](/doc/libs/1_74_0/doc/html/boost_asio/history.html) for further details.
* [Atomic](/libs/atomic/):

	+ Added missing `const`
	 qualifiers to some operations in `atomic\_ref`.
	+ Added support for `yield`
	 instruction on ARMv8-A. The instruction is used internally in spin
	 loops to reduce CPU power consumption.
	+ Added support for C++20 [waiting
	 and notifying operations](/doc/html/atomic/interface.html#atomic.interface.interface_wait_notify_ops). The implementation includes generic
	 backend that involves the internal lock pool, as well as specialized
	 backends for Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD and NetBSD. Atomic
	 types provide a new method `has\_native\_wait\_notify`,
	 a static boolean constant `always\_has\_native\_wait\_notify`
	 and a set of capability macros that allow to detect if the implementation
	 supports native waiting and notifying operations for a given type.
	+ Changed internal representation of `atomic\_flag`
	 to use 32-bit storage. This allows for more efficient waiting and
	 notifying operations on `atomic\_flag`
	 on some platforms.
	+ Added support for build-time configuration of the internal lock pool
	 size. The user can define the `BOOST\_ATOMIC\_LOCK\_POOL\_SIZE\_LOG2`
	 macro to specify binary logarithm of the size of the lock pool. The
	 default value is 8, meaning that the size of the lock pool is 256,
	 up from 64 used in the previous release.
	+ Added support for a new set of atomic types dedicated for [inter-process
	 communication](/doc/html/atomic/interface.html#atomic.interface.interface_ipc): `ipc\_atomic\_flag`,
	 `ipc\_atomic` and `ipc\_atomic\_ref`. Users are recommended
	 to port their code using non-IPC types for inter-process communication
	 to the new types. The new types provide the same set of operations
	 as their non-IPC counterparts, with the following differences:
	 
		- Most operations have an added precondition that `is\_lock\_free` returns `true` for the given atomic object.
		 The library will issue a compile time error if this precondition
		 is known to be not satisfied at compile time.
		- All provided operations are address-free, meaning that the
		 atomic object (in case of `ipc\_atomic\_ref`
		 - the referenced object) may be located in process-shared memory
		 or mapped into the same process at multiple different addresses.
		- The new `has\_native\_wait\_notify`
		 operation and `always\_has\_native\_wait\_notify`
		 constant indicate support for native inter-process waiting
		 and notifying operations. When that support is not present,
		 the operations are implemented with a busy loop, which is less
		 efficient, but still is address-free. A separate set of capability
		 macros is also provided to indicate this support.
	+ Added new `atomic\_unsigned\_lock\_free`
	 and `atomic\_signed\_lock\_free`
	 types introduced in C++20. The types indicate the atomic object type
	 for an unsigned or signed integer, respectively, that is lock-free
	 and preferably has native support for waiting and notifying operations.
	+ Added new gcc assembler backends for ARMv8-A (for both AArch32 and
	 AArch64). The new backends are used to implement operations not supported
	 by compiler intrinsics (including 128-bit operations on AArch64)
	 and can also be used when compiler intrinsics are not available.
	 Both little and big endian targets are supported. AArch64 backend
	 supports extensions defined in ARMv8.1 and ARMv8.3.
	+ Added support for big endian targets in the legacy ARM backend based
	 on gcc assembler blocks (this backend is used on ARMv7 and older
	 targets). Previously, the backend assumed little endian memory layout,
	 which is significant for 64-bit operations.
	+ Improved performance of seq\_cst stores and thread fences on x86 by
	 using `lock`-prefixed
	 instructions instead of `mfence`.
	 This means that the operations no longer affect non-temporal stores,
	 which was also not guaranteed before. Use specialized instructions
	 and intrinsics to order non-temporal memory accesses.
	+ Fixed capability macros for 80-bit `long
	double` on x86 targets not
	 indicating lock-free operations even if 128-bit atomic operations
	 were available.
	+ Fixed compilation of gcc asm blocks on Alpha targets.
	+ In the gcc `\_\_sync\*` intrinsics backend, fixed that store
	 and load operations of large objects (larger than a pointer size)
	 could be non-atomic. The implementation currently assumes that small
	 objects can be stored with a single instruction atomically on all
	 modern architectures.
* [Beast](/libs/beast/):

	+ This update brings bug fixes and support for the following changes
	 changes in Boost.Asio:
	+ Beast supports `BOOST\_ASIO\_NO\_DEPRECATED`.
	 Define this to help identify areas of your Beast and Asio code which
	 use deprecated Asio interfaces.
	+ Beast also supports `BOOST\_ASIO\_NO\_TS\_EXECUTORS`.
	 Define this to identify uses of executors from the now potentially
	 outdated [Networking
	 TS](https://cplusplus.github.io/networking-ts/draft.pdf)
	+ Asio will use the [Standard
	 Executors](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p0443r11.html) model by default. You can prevent this behaviour
	 by defining `BOOST\_ASIO\_USE\_TS\_EXECUTOR\_AS\_DEFAULT`
	 in which the Networking TS model will be used by default. Setting
	 this flag does not prevent a program from using executors from the
	 Standard Executors model explicitly.
	+ We'd love to know how you or your company use Beast, consider adding
	 an entry to the [Companies
	 and Individuals Using Beast](https://github.com/boostorg/beast/wiki/Companies-and-Individuals-Using-Beast) list.
	+ See the full [Release
	 Notes](/libs/beast/doc/html/beast/release_notes.html) for a complete list of changes.
* [Bimap](/libs/bimap/):

	+ Correct allocator usage (fixes C++20 compilation). (Glen Fernandes)
* [Config](/libs/config/):

	+ Implement `BOOST\_NO\_CXX11\_OVERRIDE`
	 and `BOOST\_OVERRIDE`.
	 (Glen Fernandes)
* [Core](/libs/core/):

	+ Implemented the allocator access utilities which provide a replacement
	 for `allocator\_traits`
	 with individual traits and functions for each facility. They support
	 the C++11 allocator model when possible and provide a fallback for
	 C++98 compatibility. These are now used in Circular\_Buffer, Wave,
	 Lockfree, Heap, Smart\_Ptr, Dynamic\_Bitset, Format, Bimap and more.
	 (Glen Fernandes)
* [DLL](/libs/dll/):

	+ Multiple fixes for the `library\_info`
	 work on empty shared objects.
	+ Compilation fixes for C++98 and C++11 modes ([#28](https://github.com/boostorg/dll/issues/28)).
	+ Fixes for `smart\_library`
	 manglings (thanks to XiaLiChao82 [#37](https://github.com/boostorg/dll/issues/37)).
* [Endian](/libs/endian/):

	+ Enabled scoped enumeration types in `endian\_reverse`.
	+ Enabled `bool`, `enum`, `float`,
	 `double` in `endian\_reverse\_inplace`.
	+ Added an overload of `endian\_reverse\_inplace`
	 for arrays.
* [Filesystem](/libs/filesystem/):

	+ Removed compile-time checks for support for symlinks and hardlink
	 on Windows. Instead, a runtime check is used. ([PR#142](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/pull/142))
	+ Fixed handling of reparse points in `canonical`
	 and `read\_symlink`
	 on Windows. This also affects other algorithms that involve `canonical` and `read\_symlink`
	 in their implementation. ([PR#100](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/pull/100), [#85](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/85), [#99](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/99),
	 [#123](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/123), [#125](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/125))
	+ Fixed that `read\_symlink`
	 on Windows could potentially fail or cause failures elsewhere with
	 a sharing violation error, if the same symlink was opened concurrently.
	 ([#138](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/138))
	+ Fixed that `is\_symlink(directory\_entry)` would always return `false`, even if the directory entry
	 actually referred to a symlink. ([PR#148](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/pull/148))
	+ Added missing status inspection operation overloads for `directory\_entry` and `error\_code` (e.g. `is\_directory(directory\_entry,
	error\_code&)`).
	 Removed incorrect `noexcept`
	 specifications for the overloads not taking the `error\_code`
	 arguments.
	+ `copy\_file` implementation
	 has been updated to perform checks on the source and target files,
	 as required by C++20 ([fs.op.copy.file]/4.1). In particular, the
	 operation will fail if the source or target file is not a regular
	 file or the source and target paths identify the same file.
	+ `copy\_file` on POSIX
	 systems will now also copy the source file permissions to the target
	 file, if the target file is overwritten.
	+ **New:** Added `copy\_file`
	 implementations based on `sendfile`
	 and `copy\_file\_range`
	 system calls on Linux, which may improve file copying performance,
	 especially on network filesystems.
	+ **Deprecated:** The `copy\_option`
	 enumeration that is used with the `copy\_file`
	 operation is deprecated. As a replacement, the new enum `copy\_options` (note the trailing
	 's') has been added. The new enum contains values similar to the
	 `copy\_options` enum
	 from C++20. The old enum values are mapped onto the new enum. The
	 old enum will be removed in a future release.
	+ **New:** Added `copy\_options::skip\_existing`
	 option, which allows `copy\_file`
	 operation to succeed without overwriting the target file, if it exists.
	+ **New:** Added `copy\_options::update\_existing`
	 option, which allows `copy\_file`
	 operation to conditionally overwrite the target file, if it exists,
	 if its last write time is older than that of the replacement file.
	+ **New:** `copy\_file`
	 now returns `bool`, which
	 indicates whether the file was copied.
	+ **New, breaking change:** `copy` operation has been extended
	 and reworked to implement behavior specified in C++20 [fs.op.copy].
	 This includes support for `copy\_options::recursive`,
	 `copy\_options::copy\_symlinks`, `copy\_options::skip\_symlinks`,
	 `copy\_options::directories\_only`, `copy\_options::create\_symlinks` and `copy\_options::create\_hard\_links` options. The
	 operation performs additional checks based on the specified options.
	 Applying `copy` to
	 a directory with default `copy\_options`
	 will now also copy files residing in that directory (but not nested
	 directories or files in those directories).
	+ **New:** Added `create\_directory`
	 overload taking two paths. The second path is a path to an existing
	 directory, which is used as a source of permission attributes to
	 use in the directory to create.
	+ **Deprecated:** `copy\_directory`
	 operation has been deprecated in favor of the new `create\_directory`
	 overload. Note that the two operations have reversed order of the
	 path arguments.
	+ `equivalent` on POSIX
	 systems now returns the actual error code from the OS if one of the
	 paths does not resolve to a file. Previously the function would return
	 an error code of 1. ([#141](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/141))
	+ `equivalent` no longer
	 considers file size and last modification time in order to test whether
	 the two paths refer to the same file. These checks could result in
	 a false negative if the file was modified during the `equivalent` call.
	+ **New:** Added `absolute`
	 overloads taking `error\_code`
	 argument.
	+ Operations that have `current\_path()` as the default value of their arguments
	 and also have an `error\_code`
	 argument will use the `current\_path(error\_code& ec)` overload to obtain the current path,
	 so that its failure is reported via the `error\_code`
	 argument instead of an exception.
	+ `space` now initializes
	 the `space\_info` structure
	 members to -1 values on error, as required by C++20 ([fs.op.space]/1).
	+ `space` on Windows
	 now accepts paths referring to arbitrary files, not only directories.
	 This is similar to POSIX systems and corresponds to the operation
	 description in C++20. ([#73](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/73))
	+ **New:** Added implementation of `temp\_directory\_path` for Windows
	 CE. ([PR#25](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/pull/25))
	+ **New:** Improved compatibility with
	 [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) platform. ([PR#144](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/pull/144))
	+ **New:** Improved support for Embarcadero
	 compilers. ([PR#130](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/pull/130))
	+ **New:** Added implementations of `unique\_path` operation based on
	 `getrandom` (Linux),
	 `arc4random\_buf` (OpenBSD/FreeBSD/CloudABI)
	 and BCrypt (Windows) system APIs.
	+ **Deprecated:** Auto-linking against
	 system libraries on Windows with MSVC-compatible compilers is deprecated
	 and will be removed in a future release. This affects users linking
	 against static library of Boost.Filesystem. Users are advised to
	 update their project build systems to either use a shared library
	 of Boost.Filesystem, or explicitly specify the dependencies of Boost.Filesystem
	 in the linker command line. Users of shared library of Boost.Filesystem
	 are not affected.

	+ Added
	 
		- Added new constructor initializing `any\_image`
		 from r-value reference to any image ([PR#486](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/486)).
		- Implemented mechanism to reverse `kernel\_2d`
		 ([PR#489](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/489)).
	+ Changed
	 
		- BREAKING: Replace Boost.Variant with Boost.Variant2 ([PR#474](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/474))

	+ Acknowledgements
	 
		- Samuel Debionne, Pranam Lashkari, Mateusz Loskot, Debabrata
		 Mandal
* [Heap](/libs/heap/):

	+ Correct destruction of top node in `skew\_heap`.

	+ Correct and simplify allocator use. (Glen Fernandes)
* [Integer](/libs/integer/):

	+ Fixed compilation of `gcd`

	+ Fixes for the the Embarcadero compilers (thanks to Edward Diener).
* [Log](/libs/log/):

	+ Bug fixes:
	 
		- The syslog sink backend now verifies the IP version of the
		 local and target addresses set by user. The addresses must
		 have the same IP version as was specified in the `ip\_version` named parameter
		 on the sink backend construction (by default, IPv4 is assumed).
		 When an address is obtained as a result of host name resolution,
		 only addresses with matching IP version are considered. ([#119](https://github.com/boostorg/log/issues/119))
	+ New Features:
	 
		- Move constructors and assignment operators of various components
		 were marked `noexcept`.
		- Added a new `range\_manip`
		 stream manipulator that can be used for outputting elements

		 stream manipulator that can be used for outputting optionally
		 present values.
	+ See [changelog](/libs/log/doc/html/log/changelog.html)
	 for more details.
* [Mp11](/libs/mp11/):

	+ Improved compilation performance of `mp\_with\_index<N>` for large `N`.
	+ Added `tuple\_transform`
	 (contributed by Hans Dembinski.)
* [Multi-index Containers](/libs/multi_index/):

	+ Added [node
	 extraction and insertion](/libs/multi_index/doc/tutorial/basics.html#node_handling) following the analogous interface
	 of associative containers as introduced in C++17. This feature has
	 also been extended to non key-based indices, in contrast to C++ standard
	 library sequence containers, which do not provide such functionality.
	+ Clarified documentation on read/write key extractors (issue [#32](https://github.com/boostorg/multi_index/issues/32)).
	+ Maintenance work.
* [Nowide](/libs/nowide/):

	+ The library now requires a C++11-compliant compiler and stdlib
	+ LFS: Add support for files > 2 GB where the underlying system
	 supports it
	+ Generic UTF conversion functions are now available in the `boost::nowide::utf namespace`
	+ Add support for `stat`
	 with UTF-8 paths
* [Outcome](/libs/outcome/):

	+ Announcements:
	 
		- The v2.1 branch is expected to be retired end of 2020, with
		 the v2.2 branch becoming the default. You can use the future
		 v2.2 branch now using [`better\_optimisation`](https://github.com/ned14/outcome/tree/better_optimisation).
		 This branch has a number of major breaking changes to Outcome
		 v2.1, see the front page for details.
	+ Enhancements:
	 
		- BREAKING CHANGE `void`
		 results and outcomes no longer default construct types during
		 explicit construction. Previously if you explicitly constructed
		 a `result<T>`
		 from a non-errored `result<void>`, it default constructed
		 `T`. This was
		 found to cause unhelpful surprise, so it has been disabled.
		- New macro `OUTCOME\_ENABLE\_LEGACY\_SUPPORT\_FOR`.
		 The macro `OUTCOME\_ENABLE\_LEGACY\_SUPPORT\_FOR`
		 can be used to enable aliasing of older naming and features
		 to newer naming and features when using a newer version of
		 Outcome.
		- Concepts now have snake case style naming instead of camel
		 case style. When Outcome was first implemented, it was thought
		 that C++ 20 concepts were going to have camel case style. This
		 was changed before the C++ 20 release, and Outcome's concepts
		 have been renamed similarly. This won't break any code in Outcome
		 v2.1, as compatibility aliases are provided. However code compiled
		 against Outcome v2.2 will need to be upgraded, unless `OUTCOME\_ENABLE\_LEGACY\_SUPPORT\_FOR`
		 is set to `210` or
		 lower.
		- Concepts now live in `OUTCOME\_V2\_NAMESPACE::concepts`
		 namespace. Previously concepts lived in the `convert`
		 namespace, now they live in their own namespace.
		- New concepts `basic\_result<T>` and `basic\_outcome<T>` added. End users were finding
		 an unhelpful gap in between `is\_basic\_result<T>` and `value\_or\_error<T>` where they wanted a concept
		 that matched types which were `basic\_result`,
		 but not exactly one of those. Concepts filling that gap were
		 added.
		- Operation `TRY`
		 works differently from Outcome v2.2 onwards. This is a severely
		 code breaking change which change the syntax of how one uses
		 `OUTCOME\_TRY()`. A regular expression suitable
		 for upgrading code can be found in the list of changes between
		 Outcome v2.1 and v2.2.

		- [#224](https://github.com/ned14/outcome/issues/224)
		 The clang Apple ships in Xcode 11.4 (currently the latest)
		 has not been patched with the fixes to LLVM clang that fix
		 `noexcept(std::is\_constructible<T,
		void>)`
		 failing to compile which I originally submitted years ago.
		 So give up waiting on Apple to fix their clang, add a workaround
		 to Outcome.
		- Spare storage could not be used from within no-value policy
		 classes. Due to an obvious brain fart when writing the code
		 at the time, the spare storage APIs had the wrong prototype
		 which prevented them working from within policy classes. Sorry.
* [PolyCollection](/libs/poly_collection/):

	+ Fixed internal ambiguity problem between `boost::type\_erasure::any`
	 and `boost::any` (issue [#17](https://github.com/boostorg/poly_collection/issues/17)).
	+ Maintenance work.
* [SmartPtr](/libs/smart_ptr/):

	+ Added `owner\_equals`
	 to `shared\_ptr`, `weak\_ptr`, `local\_shared\_ptr`.
	+ Added `owner\_hash\_value`
	 to `shared\_ptr`, `weak\_ptr`.
	+ Added `owner\_equal\_to`,
	 `owner\_hash`.
	+ Added `std::hash` specializations for `shared\_ptr`, `local\_shared\_ptr`.
	+ Added `boost::hash` support to, and `std::hash`, `std::equal\_to`
	 specializations for, `weak\_ptr`.
* [Stacktrace](/libs/stacktrace/):

	+ Fixed a build error when compiled with `-fno-exceptions` (thanks to Jeremiah
	 Rodriguez [#91](https://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/91)).
* [System](/libs/system/):

	+ `operator bool()` now returns `failed()` instead of `value() != 0`.
* [Type\_Traits](/libs/type_traits/):

	+ Implemented `conjunction`,
	 `disjunction`, `negation`, `is\_trivially\_copyable`,
	 `is\_scoped\_enum`, and
	 `is\_unscoped\_enum`.
	 (Glen Fernandes)
* [Variant](/libs/variant/):

	+ Fixed warnings on missing `override`
	 (thanks to EugeneZelenko [#78](https://github.com/boostorg/variant/issues/78)).
	+ Fixes for the the Embarcadero compilers (thanks to Edward Diener
	 [#79](https://github.com/boostorg/variant/issues/79)).
	+ Updated header locations to avoid warnings about using deprecated
	 headers (thanks to Andrey Semashev [#80](https://github.com/boostorg/variant/issues/80))
* [Variant2](/libs/variant2/):

	+ Added support for derived types in `visit`.
	+ Improved compilation performance for many (hundreds of) alternatives.
	+ Added support for `visit<R>`.
* [Wave](/libs/wave/):

	+ Implement C++20 features for variadics, including `\_\_VA\_OPT\_\_`
	 ([PR#75](https://github.com/boostorg/wave/pull/75))
	+ Implement `\_\_has\_include`
	 ([PR#102](https://github.com/boostorg/wave/pull/102))
	+ Introduce new sample: `check\_macro\_naming`,
	 useful with Boost itself ([PR#97](https://github.com/boostorg/wave/pull/97))
	+ Fix compilation issue caused by `std::allocator`
	 member removal in C++20 ([PR#72](https://github.com/boostorg/wave/pull/72))
	+ Repair Xpressive lexer and `token\_statistics`
	 sample ([PR#79](https://github.com/boostorg/wave/pull/79))
	+ Repair lexertl lexer ([PR#78](https://github.com/boostorg/wave/pull/78))
	+ Ensure hooks are run on predefined macros as well ([PR#87](https://github.com/boostorg/wave/pull/87))
	+ Various minor bug fixes
	+ C++98/03 support is now deprecated and will be removed in 1.77
* [YAP](/libs/yap/):

	+ Fixed compilation errors for placeholders; they now work in the general
	 case, and in particular work with yap::print().
	+ constexpr all the YAP.
	+ Fix printing of correct value category in yap::print().
	+ Doc clarification.

### Updated Tools


* [Boostbook](/tools/boostbook/):

	+ Change encoding of generated documentation from US-ASCII to UTF-8.
