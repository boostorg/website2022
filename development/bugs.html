Reporting Boost bugs
====================


1. If you know where to look in the source code, make sure
 the bug isn't already fixed in the latest sources. The most
 recent version of everything on the Boost web site is
 available from the [git repositories](https://github.com/boostorg/wiki/wiki/Getting-Started).
2. [Search the issues](https://github.com/boostorg/)
 on GitHub to make sure we don't already know about the bug.
 If we do, you can add further information to an existing bug ticket.
3. [Create a new issues](https://github.com/boostorg/)
 in the repository of the particular library of your interest.


If possible,


	* Describe the problem carefully, including steps required to
	 reproduce it by a library maintainers.
	* Attach a *minimal* and *complete*
	 program that reproduces the problem. Aside from helping
	 the library maintainer fix the problem, you may find
	 the bug in your own code, which can avoid a costly
	 delay waiting for a response.
If You Have a Fix for the Bug
-----------------------------
After completing the steps above, please submit a patch
 or a pull request as described in
 [the wiki](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/StartModPatchAndPullReq "Getting Started with Patches and Pull Requests").
