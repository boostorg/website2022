Coding Guidelines for Integral Constant Expressions



Coding Guidelines for Integral Constant Expressions
===================================================

Integral Constant Expressions are used in many places in
 C++; as array bounds, as bit-field lengths, as enumerator
 initialisers, and as arguments to non-type template parameters.
 However many compilers have problems handling integral constant
 expressions; as a result of this, programming using non-type
 template parameters in particular can be fraught with
 difficulty, often leading to the incorrect assumption that
 non-type template parameters are unsupported by a particular
 compiler. This short article is designed to provide a set of
 guidelines and workarounds that, if followed, will allow
 integral constant expressions to be used in a manner portable
 to all the compilers currently supported by boost. Although
 this article is mainly targeted at boost library authors, it
 may also be useful for users who want to understand why boost
 code is written in a particular way, or who want to write
 portable code themselves.


What is an Integral Constant Expression?
----------------------------------------


Integral constant expressions are described in section 5.19
 of the standard, and are sometimes referred to as "compile time
 constants". An integral constant expression can be one of the
 following:


1. A literal integral value, for example `0u` or
 `3L`.
2. An enumerator value.
3. Global integral constants, for example:
 
```

const int my\_INTEGRAL\_CONSTANT = 3;

```
4. Static member constants, for example:
 
```

struct myclass
{ static const int value = 0; };

```
5. Member enumerator values, for example:
 
```

struct myclass
{ enum{ value = 0 }; };

```
6. Non-type template parameters of integral or enumerator
 type.
7. The result of a `sizeof` expression, for
 example:
 
```

sizeof(foo(a, b, c))

```
8. The result of a `static_cast`, where the
 target type is an integral or enumerator type, and the
 argument is either another integral constant expression, or a
 floating-point literal.
9. The result of applying a binary operator to two integral
 constant expressions:
 
```

INTEGRAL\_CONSTANT1 op INTEGRAL\_CONSTANT2

```
provided that the operator is not an assignment operator, or comma
operator.
10. The result of applying a unary operator to an integral
 constant expression:
 
```

op INTEGRAL\_CONSTANT1

```
provided that the operator is not the increment or decrement operator.


Coding Guidelines
-----------------


The following guidelines are declared in no particular order
 (in other words you need to obey all of them - sorry!), and may
 also be incomplete, more guidelines may be added as compilers
 change and/or more problems are encountered.


### When declaring constants that are class members always use
 the macro `BOOST_STATIC_CONSTANT.`
```

template <class T>
struct myclass
{
   BOOST\_STATIC\_CONSTANT(int, value = sizeof(T));
};

```

Rationale: not all compilers support inline initialisation
 of member constants, others treat member enumerators in strange
 ways (they're not always treated as integral constant
 expressions). The BOOST\_STATIC\_CONSTANT macro uses the most
 appropriate method for the compiler in question.


### Don't declare integral constant expressions whose type is
 wider than int.


Rationale: while in theory all integral types are usable in
 integral constant expressions, in practice many compilers limit
 integral constant expressions to types no wider than
 `int`.


### Don't use logical operators in integral constant
 expressions; use template meta-programming instead.


The header `<boost/type_traits/ice.hpp>`
 contains a number of workaround templates, that fulfil the role
 of logical operators, for example instead of:
```

INTEGRAL\_CONSTANT1 || INTEGRAL\_CONSTANT2

```

Use:
```

::boost::type\_traits::ice\_or<INTEGRAL\_CONSTANT1,INTEGRAL\_CONSTANT2>::value

```

Rationale: A number of compilers (particularly the Borland
 and Microsoft compilers), tend to not to recognise integral
 constant expressions involving logical operators as genuine
 integral constant expressions. The problem generally only shows
 up when the integral constant expression is nested deep inside
 template code, and is hard to reproduce and diagnose.


### Don't use any operators in an integral constant expression
 used as a non-type template parameter


Rather than:
```

typedef myclass<INTEGRAL\_CONSTANT1 ==
              INTEGRAL\_CONSTANT2> mytypedef;

```

Use:
```

typedef myclass< some\_symbol>
              mytypedef;

```

Where `some_symbol` is the symbolic name of a an
 integral constant expression whose value is
 `(INTEGRAL_CONSTANT1 == INTEGRAL_CONSTANT2).`


Rationale: the older EDG based compilers (some of which are
 used in the most recent version of that platform's compiler),
 don't recognise expressions containing operators as non-type
 template parameters, even though such expressions can be used
 as integral constant expressions elsewhere.


### Always use a fully qualified name to refer to an integral
 constant expression.


For example:
```

typedef myclass< ::boost::is\_integral<some\_type>::value> mytypedef;

```

Rationale: at least one compiler (Borland's), doesn't
 recognise the name of a constant as an integral constant
 expression unless the name is fully qualified (which is to say
 it starts with `::`).


### Always leave a space after a '`<`' and before
 '`::`'


For example:
```

typedef myclass< ::boost::is\_integral<some\_type>::value> mytypedef;
                ^
                ensure there is space here!

```

Rationale: `<:` is a legal digraph in it's own
 right, so `<::` is interpreted as the same as
 `[:`.


### Don't use local names as integral constant expressions


Example:
```

template <class T>
struct foobar
{
   BOOST\_STATIC\_CONSTANT(int, temp = computed\_value);
   typedef myclass<temp> mytypedef;  // error
};

```

Rationale: At least one compiler (Borland's) doesn't accept
 this.


Although it is possible to fix this by using:
```

template <class T>
struct foobar
{
   BOOST\_STATIC\_CONSTANT(int, temp = computed\_value);
   typedef foobar self\_type;
   typedef myclass<(self\_type::temp)> mytypedef;  // OK
};

```

This breaks at least one other compiler (VC6), it is better
 to move the integral constant expression computation out into a
 separate traits class:
```

template <class T>
struct foobar\_helper
{
   BOOST\_STATIC\_CONSTANT(int, value = computed\_value);
};

template <class T>
struct foobar
{
   typedef myclass< ::foobar\_helper<T>::value> mytypedef;  // OK
};

```

### Don't use dependent default parameters for non-type
 template parameters.


For example:
```

template <class T, int I = ::boost::is\_integral<T>::value>  // Error can't deduce value of I in some cases.
struct foobar;

```

Rationale: this kind of usage fails for Borland C++. Note
 that this is only an issue where the default value is dependent
 upon a previous template parameter, for example the following
 is fine:
```

template <class T, int I = 3>  // OK, default value is not dependent
struct foobar;

```

Unresolved Issues
-----------------


The following issues are either unresolved or have fixes
 that are compiler specific, and/or break one or more of the
 coding guidelines.


### Be careful of numeric\_limits


There are three issues here:


1. The header <limits> may be absent - it is
 recommended that you never include <limits> directly
 but use <boost/pending/limits.hpp> instead. This header
 includes the "real" <limits> header if it is available,
 otherwise it supplies it's own std::numeric\_limits
 definition. Boost also defines the macro BOOST\_NO\_LIMITS if
 <limits> is absent.
2. The implementation of std::numeric\_limits may be defined
 in such a way that its static-const members may not be usable
 as integral constant expressions. This contradicts the
 standard but seems to be a bug that affects at least two
 standard library vendors; boost defines
 BOOST\_NO\_LIMITS\_COMPILE\_TIME\_CONSTANTS in
 <boost/config.hpp> when this is the case.
3. There is a strange bug in VC6, where the members of
 std::numeric\_limits can be "prematurely evaluated" in
 template code, for example:
```

template <class T>
struct limits\_test
{
   BOOST\_STATIC\_ASSERT(::std::numeric\_limits<T>::is\_specialized);
};

```

This code fails to compile with VC6 even though no instances
 of the template are ever created; for some bizarre reason
 `::std::numeric_limits<T>::is_specialized`
 always evaluates to false, irrespective of what the template
 parameter T is. The problem seems to be confined to expressions
 which depend on std::numeric\_limts: for example if you replace
 `::std::numeric_limits<T>::is_specialized`
 with `::boost::is_arithmetic<T>::value`, then
 everything is fine. The following workaround also works but
 conflicts with the coding guidelines:
```

template <class T>
struct limits\_test
{
   BOOST\_STATIC\_CONSTANT(bool, check = ::std::numeric\_limits<T>::is\_specialized);
   BOOST\_STATIC\_ASSERT(check);
};

```

So it is probably best to resort to something like this:
```

template <class T>
struct limits\_test
{
#ifdef BOOST\_MSVC
   BOOST\_STATIC\_CONSTANT(bool, check = ::std::numeric\_limits<T>::is\_specialized);
   BOOST\_STATIC\_ASSERT(check);
#else
   BOOST\_STATIC\_ASSERT(::std::numeric\_limits<T>::is\_specialized);
#endif
};

```

### Be careful how you use the sizeof operator


As far as I can tell, all compilers treat sizeof expressions
 correctly when the argument is the name of a type (or a
 template-id), however problems can occur if:


1. The argument is the name of a member-variable, or a local
 variable (code may not compile with VC6).
2. The argument is an expression which involves the creation
 of a temporary (code will not compile with Borland C++).
3. The argument is an expression involving an overloaded
 function call (code compiles but the result is a garbage
 value with Metroworks C++).


### Don't use boost::is\_convertible unless you have to


Since is\_convertible is implemented in terms of the sizeof
 operator, it consistently gives the wrong value when used with
 the Metroworks compiler, and may not compile with the Borland's
 compiler (depending upon the template arguments used).
