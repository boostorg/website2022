Boost IRC Hangouts



Boost IRC Hangouts
==================

Boost users and developers spend time in various IRC
 channels to generally work together. The attendance and traffic
 of the channels vary greatly but there is usually someone
 around to chat. And many times chat about just about any topic,
 not just about the Boost C++ Libraries.


Even though the channels are not moderated in the strict
 sense, for some there is the expectation that one should follow
 the usual Boost discussion rules of civility. This is both as a
 recognition that the Boost community is varied in age, and in
 sensibilities. So please keep your language clean. And don't be
 surprised if you find yourself reprimanded by the ops.


Our channels can be found on the [freenode](http://freenode.net/) network.


#boost
------


This is the main channel, and as such sees a good deal of
 traffic at times. Most times one can find about 80 "people"
 (there are a few bots in there) and a good representation from
 Boost developers. If you are looking for some quick help in
 getting something in Boost working this is a good place to
 go.

##c++
-----


This is rather chatty but topical, hence the ## in the name,
 C++ language discussion channel. Many of the same people who
 hang out in the #boost channel, also hang out here.
