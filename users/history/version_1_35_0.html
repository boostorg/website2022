### Updated Libraries


* [Graph](/libs/graph/doc/index.html):
 Generic graph
 components and algorithms. Highlights:
 
	+ `kolmogorov\_max\_flow`,
	 from Stephan Diederich as part of the 2006 Google Summer of Code.
	+ `read\_dimacs\_max\_flow`
	 and `write\_dimacs\_max\_flow`
	 for max-flow problems, from Stephan Diederich.
	+ `read\_graphml` and
	 `write\_graphml` for
	 GraphML input/output, from Tiago de Paula Peixoto.
	+ `minimum\_cycle\_ratio`
	 and `maximum\_cycle\_ratio`,
	 from Dmitry Bufistov and Andrey Parfenov.
	+ `boyer\_myrvold\_planarity\_test`,
	 along with a suite of algorithms for planar graphs, from Aaron Windsor.
	+ LEDA Adaptor improvements, from Jens Müller.
* [Hash](/libs/functional/hash/index.html):
 A TR1
 hash function object, from Daniel James. Highlights:
 
	+ Support for `long long`,
	 `std::complex`.
	+ Improved the algorithm for hashing floating point numbers.
	+ A few bug and warning fixes.
* [Iostreams](/libs/iostreams/index.html): Framework
 for defining streams, stream buffers and i/o filters, from Jonathan Turkanis.
 Highlights:
 
	+ Clarified the semantics of close(). This fixes several bugs but will
	 break some existing code. See [Release
	 Notes](/libs/iostreams/doc/index.html?path=12) for details.
	+ Numerous other bug fixes and optimizations.
* [Multi Array](/libs/multi_array/index.html):

	+ Added "dimensionality" compile-time constante to the MultiArray
	 concept.
	+ For greater control over error situations, uses of C++ assert have
	 been replaced with BOOST\_ASSERT.
	+ Fixed a bug with simultaneous resizing and reindexing.
* [Multi-index Containers](/libs/multi_index/doc/index.html):

	+ New [`global\_fun`](/libs/multi_index/doc/tutorial/key_extraction.html#global_fun) predefined key
	 extractor.
	+ Added [`iterator\_to`](/libs/multi_index/doc/tutorial/indices.html#iterator_to) facility.
	+ Included [support
	 for non-standard allocators](/libs/multi_index/doc/tutorial/creation.html#special_allocator) such as those of [Boost.Interprocess](/libs/interprocess/index.html),
	 which makes `multi\_index\_container`s
	 placeable in shared memory.
	+ New versions of `modify`
	 and `modify\_key` with
	 rollback, as described in the [tutorial](/libs/multi_index/doc/tutorial/basics.html#ord_updating).
	+ A number of optimizations and minor improvements have also been included.
	 For a complete list of changes, see the library [release
	 notes](/libs/multi_index/doc/release_notes.html#boost_1_35).
* [Serialization](/libs/serialization/index.html):
 Boost.Serialization
 has been updated with optimizations for dense arrays.
* [Thread](/libs/thread/index.html):

	+ The Thread library has been updated to be more in line with the C++0x
	 working draft.
	+ Instances of boost::thread and of the various lock types are now
	 movable.
	+ Threads can be interrupted at interruption points.
	+ Condition variables can now be used with any type that implements
	 the Lockable concept, through the use of `boost::condition\_variable\_any`
	 (`boost::condition` is a typedef to `boost::condition\_variable\_any`, provided
	 for backwards compatibility). `boost::condition\_variable`
	 is provided as an optimization, and will only work with `boost::unique\_lock<boost::mutex>`
	 (`boost::mutex::scoped\_lock`).
	+ Thread IDs are separated from boost::thread, so a thread can obtain
	 it's own ID (using `boost::this\_thread::get\_id()`), and IDs can be used as keys in
	 associative containers, as they have the full set of comparison operators.
	+ Timeouts are now implemented using the Boost DateTime library, through
	 a typedef `boost::system\_time` for absolute timeouts,
	 and with support for relative timeouts in many cases. `boost::xtime` is supported for backwards
	 compatibility only.
	+ Locks are implemented as publicly accessible templates `boost::lock\_guard`, `boost::unique\_lock`,
	 `boost::shared\_lock`, and `boost::upgrade\_lock`, which are templated
	 on the type of the mutex. The Lockable concept has been extended
	 to include publicly available `lock()` and `unlock()` member functions, which are used
	 by the lock types.
	+ `boost::try\_mutex` has been removed, and
	 the functionality subsumed into `boost::mutex`.
	 `boost::try\_mutex` is left as a typedef,
	 but is no longer a separate class.
	+ `boost::recursive\_try\_mutex` has been removed,
	 and the functionality subsumed into `boost::recursive\_mutex`.
	 `boost::recursive\_try\_mutex` is left as
	 a typedef, but is no longer a separate class.
	+ `boost::detail::thread::lock\_ops` has been removed. Code
	 that relies on the `lock\_ops`
	 implementation detail will no longer work, as this has been removed,
	 as it is no longer necessary now that mutex types now have public
	 `lock()`
	 and `unlock()`
	 member functions.
	+ `scoped\_lock` constructors
	 with a second parameter of type bool are no longer provided. With
	 previous boost releases, `boost::mutex::scoped\_lock
	some\_lock(some\_mutex,false);`
	 could be used to create a lock object that was associated with a
	 mutex, but did not lock it on construction. This facility has now
	 been replaced with the constructor that takes a `boost::defer\_lock\_type`
	 as the second parameter: `boost::mutex::scoped\_lock
	some\_lock(some\_mutex,boost::defer\_lock);`
	+ The broken `boost::read\_write\_mutex`
	 has been replaced with `boost::shared\_mutex`.
* [Wave](/libs/wave/index.html): Standards conformant
 implementation of the mandated C99/C++ preprocessor functionality packed
 behind an easy to use iterator interface, from Hartmut Kaiser. Highlights:
 
	+ Added the possibility to continue the preprocessing after an error
	 occured.
	+ Added the macro introspection API to the wave::context object.
	+ Added threading support to the library.
	+ Improved the overall performance by upto 30%.
	+ Changed and unified preprocessor hook interface (this is an interface
	 breaking change!), added several new preprocessor hook functions.
	+ Added serialization support.
	+ Added new examples (for instance: Hannibal - a partial C++ parser,
	 by Danny Havenith).
	+ Added a new lexical analyzer based on Ben Hansons Lexertl library.
	+ Fixed a large number of other bugs and problems.
* [Xpressive](/libs/xpressive/index.html): Regular
 expressions that can be written as strings or as expression templates,
 and that can refer to each other and themselves recursively with the power
 of context-free grammars, from Eric Niebler. Highlights:
 
	+ Added *semantic actions* to static regexes. A
	 semantic action is code that executes when part of a regular expression
	 matches.
	+ Added *custom assertions* to static regexes. A
	 custom assertion is a Boolean predicate that can participate in the
	 regex match.
	+ Added *named regexes* for embedding a static or
	 dynamic regex into a dynamic regex. This can be used to create dynamic
	 regex grammars.
	+ Added *named captures* to dynamic regexes, like
	 Perl.
