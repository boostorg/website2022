=============

![-](samuel_krempp.jpg)
 Samuel Krempp is teaching Mathematics and Computer Science at
 the university technology institute *I.U.T.
 Tremblay-en-France* near Paris.


Programming has been his leisure until he entered the 'Ecole
 Normale Supérieure de Cachan' and got into C++ for his
 studies and research in applied mathematics and image
 recognition.


He enjoys many other things - among them photography, riding
 his bicycle, and scuba-diving in wonderful, warm, sunny seas
 when he can afford it.


He's the author of the [Boost Format
 library](/doc/libs/release/libs/format/index.html).
