Boost.Locale security notice
----------------------------

 Boost.Locale library in Boost 1.48 to 1.52 including has a security flaw.
 
`boost::locale::utf::utf\_traits`
 accepted some invalid UTF-8 sequences.
 
 Applications that used these functions for UTF-8 input validation could expose
 themselves to security threats as invalid UTF-8 sequece would be considered as
 valid.
 
 This bug is fixed in upcoming Boost 1.53.
 
 For more details see: [#7743](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7743)

 Users who can't upgrade to the latest versions may apply the following patch
 to fix the problem.
