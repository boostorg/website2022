### Known Issues
 Boost.Operators is currently **incompatible with C++20**
 compilers, which in some cases may manifest as an infinite recursion or infinite
 loop in runtime when a comparison operator is called. The problem is caused
 by the new operator rewriting behavior introduced in C++20. As a workaround,
 users are advised to target C++17 or older C++ standard. More details can be
 found in [#65](https://github.com/boostorg/utility/issues/65).
 

### New Libraries


* [JSON](/libs/json/): JSON parsing, serialization,
 and DOM in C++11, from Vinnie Falco and Krystian Stasiowski.
 
	+ Fast compilation requiring only C++11
	+ Easy and safe modern API with allocator support
	+ Compile without Boost, define `BOOST\_JSON\_STANDALONE`
	+ Optional header-only, without linking to a library
* [LEAF](/libs/leaf/): A lightweight error-handling
 library for C++11, from Emil Dotchevski.
 
	+ Small single-header format, no dependencies.
	+ Designed for maximum efficiency ("happy" path and "sad"
	 path).
	+ No dynamic memory allocations, even with heavy payloads.
	+ O(1) transport of arbitrary error types (independent of call stack
	 depth).
	+ Can be used with or without exception handling.
* [PFR](/libs/pfr/): Basic reflection without macro
 or boilerplate code for user defined types, from Antony Polukhin.

### Updated Libraries


* [Asio](/libs/asio/):

	+ Enabled support for UNIX domain sockets on Windows.
	+ Added executor-converting construction and assignment to `ip::basic\_resolver`.
	+ Added compatibility between polymorphic executors and the (deprecated)
	 handler invocation hook.
	+ Added the `experimental::as\_single`
	 completion token adapter.
	+ Added support for `MSG\_NOSIGNAL`
	 on more platforms by using `\_POSIX\_VERSION`
	 to detect whether it is supported.
	+ Added the ability to compile using libpthread on Windows.
	+ Added workarounds for the Intel C++ compiler.
	+ Added more support for detecting and optimising for handlers that
	 have no custom executor.
	+ Reduced lock contention for timer cancellation on Windows.
	+ Reinstated a previously removed null-pointer check, as it had a measurable
	 impact on performance.
	+ Fixed the `executor`
	 concept to test for a const-qualified `execute()`.
	+ Fixed `any\_executor`
	 support for builds without RTTI support.
	+ Fixed the `thread\_pool`
	 unit test to work without RTTI support.
	+ Fixed C++20 coroutines compatibility with clang on Windows.
	+ Fixed some compatibility issues with Windows Runtime.
	+ Fixed shadow name warnings caused by addition of `asio::query`.

	+ Added missing `push/pop\_options.hpp`
	 includes.
	+ Suppressed zero-as-null-pointer-constant warnings.
	+ Fixed a comma-operator warning.
	+ Updated the documentation to clarify when the select
	 reactor is used on Windows.
	+ Fixed potential ambiguity caused by `any\_executor`
	 comparisons and conversion.
	+ Added detection of non-experimental C++20 coroutines on MSVC 19.8.
	+ Fixed compatibility with uClibc.
	+ Fixed `strand<>`
	 adaptation of Networking TS executors when targeting older C++ versions
	 or less conformant compilers.
	+ Consult the [Revision
	 History](/doc/libs/1_75_0/doc/html/boost_asio/history.html) for further details.
* [Atomic](/libs/atomic/):

	+ Implemented SSE2 and SSE4.1 versions of address lookup algorithm,
	 which is used in the internal lock pool implementation. This may
	 improve performance of waiting and notifying operations in heavily
	 contended cases.
	+ Fixed a possible compilation error on AArch64 targets caused by incorrect
	 instructions generated for bitwise (logical) operations with immediate
	 constants. ([#41](https://github.com/boostorg/atomic/issues/41))
* [Beast](/libs/beast/):

	+ This update brings bug fixes and support for the `BOOST\_ASIO\_ENBALE\_HANDLER\_TRACKING`
	 compile flag from Boost.Asio:
	+ We'd love to know how you or your company use Beast, consider adding
	 an entry to the [Companies
	 and Individuals Using Beast](https://github.com/boostorg/beast/wiki/Companies-and-Individuals-Using-Beast) list.
	+ See the full [Release
	 Notes](/libs/beast/doc/html/beast/release_notes.html) for a complete list of changes.
* [Container](/libs/container/):

	+ New `devector`
	 container.
	+ Fixed bugs/issues:
	 
		- [#152](https://github.com/boostorg/container/issues/152) Tree-based containers have troubles with move-only
		 types.
		- [#156](https://github.com/boostorg/container/issues/156) Compile error with vector.
		- [PR#157](https://github.com/boostorg/container/pull/157) Add missing include.
		- [#159](https://github.com/boostorg/container/issues/159): pmr::monotonic\_buffer\_resource crashes on
		 large single allocations.
		- [#160](https://github.com/boostorg/container/issues/160): Usage of uses\_allocator needs a remove\_cvref\_t.
		- [#162](https://github.com/boostorg/container/issues/162): small\_vector on MSVC x86 call-by-value crash.
		- [#161](https://github.com/boostorg/container/issues/161): polymorphic\_allocator(memory\_resource\*) non-standard
		 extension causes headache.
		- [PR#163](https://github.com/boostorg/container/pull/163): container\_rebind for small\_vector with
		 options.
		- [#165](https://github.com/boostorg/container/issues/165): Link error with shared library and memory\_resource
		 inline members.
		- [PR#166](https://github.com/boostorg/container/pull/166): Fix encoding error in copyright headers.
		- [PR#167](https://github.com/boostorg/container/pull/167): error: the address of 'msg' will always
		 evaluate as 'true' warning with GCC 4.4.
		- [#169](https://github.com/boostorg/container/issues/169): flood of warnings building dlmalloc\_ext\_2\_8\_6.c
		 on clang11.
* [Endian](/libs/endian/):

	+ `endian\_arithmetic`
	 no longer inherits from `endian\_buffer`
	+ When `BOOST\_ENDIAN\_NO\_CTORS`
	 is defined, the unaligned `endian\_buffer`
	 and `endian\_arithmetic`
	 are C++03 PODs, to enable use of `\_\_attribute\_\_((packed))`
* [Filesystem](/libs/filesystem/):

	+ **New:** Added `creation\_time`
	 operation, which allows to obtain file creation time. (Inspired by
	 [PR#134](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/pull/134))
	+ The returned value of `last\_write\_time(p, ec)` operation in case of failure has
	 been changed to a minimal value representable by `std::time\_t`
	 instead of -1.
	+ The returned value of `hard\_link\_count(p, ec)` operation in case of failure has
	 been changed to `static\_cast<uintmax\_t>(-1)` instead of 0.
	+ On POSIX systems, `file\_size`
	 will now indicate error code `errc::function\_not\_supported`
	 if the path resolves to a non-regular file. Previously, `errc::operation\_not\_permitted` was reported.
	+ On Linux, many operations now use `statx`
	 system call internally, when possible, which allows to reduce the
	 amount of information queried from the filesystem and potentially
	 improve performance. The `statx`
	 system call was introduced in Linux kernel 4.11.
	+ Removed `const`-qualification
	 from return types of some `path`
	 methods. This could prevent move construction and move assignment
	 at the call site in some cases. ([#160](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/160))
	+ On OpenBSD 4.4 and newer, use `statvfs`
	 system call to obtain filesystem space information. (Inspired by
	 [PR#162](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/pull/162))
	+ On Windows, `space`
	 now returns with an error if the provided path does not idendify
	 an existing file. ([#167](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/167))
* [Geometry](/libs/geometry/):

	+ WARNING: Following the deprecation notice of C++03 issued with Boost
	 1.73, from now on the Boost.Geometry requires a capable C++14 compiler.
	+ Improvements
	 
		- [PR#726](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/pull/726) Umbrella strategies for area, envelope, expand
		 (undocumented for now).
		- [PR#733](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/pull/733) Added example of adaptation of std::array<>
		 to Point concept (thanks to Ben FrantzDale).
		- [PR#745](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/pull/745) constexpr added in geometries and arithmetic.
		- [PR#747](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/pull/747) Added optional traits::make (undocumented
		 for now).
		- [PR#748](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/pull/748) Modernized usage of type traits.
		- [PR#759](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/pull/759) MPL\_ASSERT replaced with standard static\_assert.
		- [PR#767](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/pull/767) Modernized usage of tuple.
	+ Solved issues
	 
		- [#716](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/issues/716) Dangling proxy references.
	+ Bugfixes
	 
		- Various fixes in set operations and buffer.
* [GIL](/libs/gil/):

	+ BREAKING: In next release, we are going to drop support for GCC 5.
	 We may also change the required minimum C++ version from C++11 to
	 C++14.
* [Histogram](/libs/histogram/):

	+ This update brings
	 
		- Bug-fixes for corner-cases
		- Small documentation improvements
		- Fixes for new warnings from latest compilers and when compiling
		 against the C++20 standard
	+ See the full [Release
	 Notes](/libs/histogram/doc/html/histogram/history.html) for a complete list of changes.
* [Interprocess](/libs/interprocess/):

	+ Fixed bugs:
	 
		- [#127](https://github.com/boostorg/interprocess/issues/127): static assertion failure with boost interprocess
		 1.74 and basic\_managed\_shared\_memory.
* [Intrusive](/libs/intrusive/):

	+ Fixed bugs:
	 
		- [PR#48](https://github.com/boostorg/intrusive/pull/48): MSVC "assignment within conditional"
		 warning fix.
		- [PR#49](https://github.com/boostorg/intrusive/pull/49): Fix empty control statement warnings.
		- [#52](https://github.com/boostorg/intrusive/issues/52): Invalid casting in BOOST\_INTRUSIVE\_BSR\_INTRINSIC.
* [Log](/libs/log/):

	+ Bug fixes:
	 
		- Corrected the file counter that would be used in `text\_file\_backend` when generating
		 the target file name (based on the pattern set by `set\_target\_file\_name\_pattern`
		 method) when the log file is rotated. ([#125](https://github.com/boostorg/log/issues/125))
		- Replaced a volatile version counter in `basic\_sink\_frontend`
		 with an atomic. ([#128](https://github.com/boostorg/log/issues/128))
		- In the `asynchronous\_sink`
		 frontend, resolved a possible conflict between `flush` and `run`
		 methods, if `run`
		 is called from a user's thread instead of the internal dedicated
		 thread spawned by the frontend. ([#131](https://github.com/boostorg/log/issues/131))
	+ See [changelog](/libs/log/doc/html/log/changelog.html)
	 for more details.
* [Move](/libs/move/):

	+ Fixed bugs:
	 
		- [#30](https://github.com/boostorg/move/issues/30): (void) C-cast is a non-portable way of suppressing
		 compiler warnings.
* [Mp11](/libs/mp11/):

	+ Added `mp\_pairwise\_fold`
	 (suggested by Barry Revzin)
	+ Removed `mp\_invoke`
	 (use `mp\_invoke\_q`)
* [Optional](/libs/optional/):

	+ `boost::none` is `constexpr`-declared.
	+ Fixed [issue
	 #78](https://github.com/boostorg/optional/issues/78).
* [Outcome](/libs/outcome/):

	+ Announcements:
	 
		- After a year and three major Boost releases announcing this
		 upcoming change, this is the FINAL RELEASE of the v2.1 branch.
		 From Boost 1.76 onwards, the v2.2 branch becomes the default.
		 This branch has a number of major breaking changes to Outcome
		 v2.1, see the documentation for details.
	+ Enhancements:
	 
		- The ADL discovered event hooks have been replaced with policy-specified
		 event hooks instead. This is due to brittleness (where hooks
		 would quietly self-disable if somebody changed something),
		 compiler bugs (a difference in compiler settings causes the
		 wrong hooks, or some but not all hooks, to get discovered),
		 and end user difficulty in using them at all. The policy-specified
		 event hooks can be told to default to ADL discovered hooks
		 for backwards compatibility: set `OUTCOME\_ENABLE\_LEGACY\_SUPPORT\_FOR`
		 to less than `220`
		 to enable emulation.
		- Improve configuring `OUTCOME\_GCC6\_CONCEPT\_BOOL`.
		 Older GCCs had boolean based concepts syntax, whereas newer
		 GCCs are standards conforming. However the precise logic of
		 when to use legacy and conforming syntax was not well understood,
		 which caused Outcome to fail to compile depending on what options
		 you pass to GCC. The new logic always uses the legacy syntax
		 if on GCC 8 or older, otherwise we use conforming syntax if
		 and only if GCC is in C++ 20 mode or later. This hopefully
		 will resolve the corner case build failures on GCC.
	+ Bug fixes:
	 
		- Boost.Outcome should now compile with `BOOST\_NO\_EXCEPTIONS`
		 defined. Thanks to Emil, maintainer of Boost.Exception, making
		 a change for me, Boost.Outcome should now compile with C++
		 exceptions globally disabled. You won't be able to use `boost::exception\_ptr` as it can't
		 be included if C++ exceptions are globally disabled.
		- [#236](https://github.com/ned14/outcome/issues/236)
		 In the Coroutine support the `final\_suspend()` was not `noexcept`,
		 despite being required to be so in the C++ 20 standard. This
		 has been fixed, but only if your compiler implements `noop\_coroutine`. Additionally,
		 if `noop\_coroutine`
		 is available, we use the much more efficient coroutine handle
		 returning variant of `await\_suspend()` which should significantly
		 improve codegen and context switching performance.
* [Polygon](/libs/polygon/):

	+ C++20 fixes for `event\_comparison\_type`,
	 `vertex\_equality\_predicate\_type`,
	 and `voronoi\_predicates`.
	 (Glen Fernandes)
* [Preprocessor](/libs/preprocessor/):

	+ When variadic data is empty in C++20 mode with \_\_VA\_OPT\_\_ support
	 the variadic size has been corrected to be 0. This also means that
	 in this C++20 mode it is now valid to convert to and from empty arrays
	 and lists and variadic data. The end-user can read the "C++20
	 Support For Variadic Macros" part of the "variadic macros"
	 topic for more information about empty variadic data in the library.
	+ The macro BOOST\_PP\_IS\_STANDARD() has been added for identifying if
	 the currently used preprocessor is a C++ standard conforming preprocessor.
	 A number of preprocessors which generally work correctly with the
	 library but need various internal workarounds, including the currently
	 default VC++ preprocessor, are not considered C++ standard conforming
	 preprocessors. However most preprocessors, including among others
	 gcc, clang, and the new but currently non-default VC++ preprocessor
	 in VS2019, are C++ standard conforming preprocessors.
	+ For C++ standard conforming preprocessors a number of the limits
	 defined in the config/limits.hpp can now be changed to higher amounts
	 for a TU. The end-user should read the "limitations" topic
	 to understand how and which limits can be changed.
	+ For C++ standard conforming preprocessors, in order to allow the
	 maximum number of FOR and WHILE iterations, the beginning 'r' and
	 'd' iteration numbers in the user-defined macros start at 1 and not
	 2, as it did in previous releases. This could be a breaking change
	 if these iteration numbers are used in the user-defined macros (
	 they probably would not be ), but the change was necessary to fix
	 some arcane bugs when dealing with numerical/logical operations with
	 maximum numbers as well to allow the user-defined macros to be called
	 the correct possible maximum number of times. For non-C++ conforming
	 preprocessors, this change was not made because those non-conforming
	 C++ preprocessors generally have limitations which disallow the maximum
	 number of looping constructs to be run, and it was felt not to introduce
	 a possible breaking change to those more fragile preprocessors would
	 be better. It was also felt that besides fixing some arcane preprocessor
	 bugs and providing the possible maximum number of user-defined macro
	 invocations, this change could be made because it has never been
	 documented what the starting 'r' and 'd' iteration numbers actually
	 are but only that these numbers are incremented for each iteration.
	+ The library has been upgraded to assume variadic macro support for
	 any compiler working with the library. Ostensibly this means that
	 the library is now a C++11 on up library, yet most of the major compilers,
	 including gcc, clang, and VC++, also support variadic macros in C++98/C++03
	 mode as long as strict compliance to C++98/C++03 is not turned on
	 when using one of those compilers.
* [Rational](/libs/rational/):

	+ Fix Rational operators to not break under new C++20 `operator==`
	 rewriting rules. (Glen Fernandes)
* [Signals2](/libs/signals2/):

	+ Correct C++ allocator model support to fix compilation in C++20 standards
	 mode. (Glen Fernandes)
* [System](/libs/system/):

	+ The platform-specific headers `windows\_error.hpp`,
	 `linux\_error.hpp`, and `cygwin\_error.hpp`
	 emit deprecation messages and are slated for removal.
	+ The old names for `generic\_category()` and `system\_category()` emit deprecation messages and are
	 slated for removal.
	+ `error\_condition::failed` is deprecated and is slated
	 for removal. `operator bool()`
	 for `error\_condition`
	 has been reverted to its old meaning of `value() != 0`. This is done for compatibility with
	 `std::error\_condition` as the next release
	 is expected to improve interoperability with `<system\_error>`
	 even further. *Note that this does not
	 affect* `error\_code::failed`,
	 which is still alive and well.
	+ The overload of `error\_condition::message`
	 that takes a buffer is deprecated and is slated for removal, for
	 the same reasons. *Note that this does
	 not affect* `error\_code::message`.
* [uBLAS](/libs/numeric/ublas/):

	+ Correct C++ allocator model support to fix compilation in C++20 standards
	 mode. (Glen Fernandes and Conrad Poelman)
* [VMD](/libs/vmd/):

	+ The VMD number parsing has been upgraded to support the ability for
	 the end-user to change the number limits in the Preprocessor library.
	+ The macro BOOST\_VMD\_IS\_GENERAL\_IDENTIFIER has been added to support
	 the parsing of input that represents a preprocessor token which matches
	 the VMD identifier syntax, without having to register the identifier
	 as a specific identifier.
* [Wave](/libs/wave/):

	+ Added new C++20 tokens, including the spaceship operator <=>
	+ Fixed bugs:
	 
		- [#94](https://github.com/boostorg/wave/issues/94): fix incorrect behavior of \_\_LINE\_\_ and \_\_FILE\_\_
		 under rescanning
