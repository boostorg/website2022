Ralf W. Grosse-Kunstleve
========================

![-](ralf_w_grosse_kunstleve.jpg) Ralf is a crystallographer. He has a degree in
 Mineralogy ([Bochum, Germany](http://www.mineralogie.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/eng/index.html)), and a Ph.D. in
 Crystallography ([ETH Zurich](http://www.crystal.mat.ethz.ch/Intro/lfkcry) , Switzerland). Real Mineralogists
 and Crystallographers run experiments with x-rays and hardware
 that is not normally associated with C++ and Boost. However,
 when Ralf kept breaking the expensive experimental equipment
 too often, he decided that he would cause less damage as a
 computational crystallographer.


Being a scientist, Ralf spent most of his life programming
 in Fortran, the great grand-father of all good programming
 languages (if you know Backus-Naur you know the name of the
 [inventor of Fortran](http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Backus.html)). Ralf is a co-author
 of the [CNS](http://cns.csb.yale.edu/) Fortran program that is very popular in
 structural biology. When he learned that a real programmer can
 write Fortran in any language, Ralf knew that it was time for
 him to learn C++. Of course, absorbing four decades of progress
 in the field of computer science all at once crashed his brain.
 To be able to deal with the challenge, he spawned two child
 processes and named them Lisa and Anna. To see Lisa, click on
 the picture and turn your monitor by 180 degrees around the
 view axis. (Other pictures of [Lisa](http://cci.lbl.gov/~rwgk/Lisa-Roza-Illes/) and [Anna](http://cci.lbl.gov/~rwgk/Anna-Rhona-Illes/) do not require gymnastics with the
 monitor.)


Right now, Ralf is working for the [Computational
 Crystallography Initiative](http://cci.lbl.gov/) at the [Lawrence Berkeley
 National Laboratory](http://www.lbl.gov/) in California. The goal of this
 initiative is to write a software system for high-throughput
 protein crystal structure determination, also known as [Structural Genomics](http://www.nigms.nih.gov/news/announcements/psi.html). Surprisingly, the gestation
 period for such a system turns out to be much longer than it
 was for Lisa and Anna. However, pre-natal diagnosis already
 revealed that Python and C++ are the parents-to-be. For an
 ultra-sound image of the new system at its early developmental
 stage [click here](http://cctbx.sourceforge.net/).
