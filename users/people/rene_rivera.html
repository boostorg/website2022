René Rivera
===========

![-](rene_rivera.jpg)
 René has spent most of his life programming in one
 language or another. From assembly, through BASIC, and up to
 C++ and Lisp, he has managed to program on a variety of
 computers and operating systems.


In the past he managed to get a concurrent MS and BS in
 Computer Science from Loyola University at Chicago. Work for
 the Institute for the Learning Sciences at Northwestern
 University building AI related systems. And worked on game
 development at Jellyvision Inc. ([jellyvision.com](http://jellyvision.com)).
 Where he lead the programming of "You Don't Know Jack: The 5th
 Dementia", and of "That's a Fact: Jack! Read.". Which where the
 basis for the development of the first two versions of "Who
 Wants To Be a Millionaire".


His motto of "clean code, clean graphics, it can always
 stand improvement" has repeatedly gotten him in trouble.
