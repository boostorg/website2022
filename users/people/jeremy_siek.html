Jeremy Siek
===========

![-](jeremy_siek.jpg)
 Jeremy Siek is a Ph.D. student at Indiana Univ.
 Bloomington.


He is the author of the Matrix Template Library (MTL), and
 helped design the Generic Graph Component Library, which is now
 the Boost Graph Library (BGL).


Once in a while Jeremy "comes up for air" and enjoys
 fencing, hiking, skiing, and reading. He's also been spotted at
 a few fightin' irish tailgaters (BYOB).


Jeremy has an intense fear for the ancient dark forests
 where dusty decks thrive and devour programmers, places where
 the light of abstraction has not yet reached.
