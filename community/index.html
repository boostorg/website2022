Community
=========

Although Boost was begun by members of the C++ Standards
 Committee Library Working Group, participation has expanded to
 include thousands of programmers from the C++ community at
 large.


If you are interested in participating in Boost, please join
 our main [developers mailing
 list](groups.html#main). Discussions are highly technical, and listed members
 are encouraged to participate in formal reviews of proposed
 libraries. There is also a [users
 mailing list](groups.html#users), and several [project specific lists](groups.html#projects).


If you are looking for more lively interaction with the
 Boost community there are also some [internet
 relay chat](irc.html) channels (freenode) that users and developers
 like to hang out in.


Below is a community maintained calendar of Boost related
 events. Mostly, this includes development of the release. Note
 that schedules slip and this might not be up to
 date.
