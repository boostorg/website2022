Copies of the C++ Standard
--------------------------
[ANSI Store](http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/product.asp?sku=INCITS%2FISO%2FIEC+14882%2D2003)
The full C++ Standard including TC1 corrections
 (INCITS/ISO/IEC 14882) is available as a PDF document for $18
 US. The document is certainly not a tutorial but is
 interesting to those who care about the precise specification
 of both the language and the standard library.
[Book](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470846747.html)
The full C++ Standard including TC1 corrections is also
 available in book form, list price $65 US. Since the content
 of the book is the same as the much cheaper ANSI PDF, the
 book form is only of interest to those who prefer a physical
 book, say for a school or company library.
