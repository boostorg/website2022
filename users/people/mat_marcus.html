 Marcus](http://www.emarcus.org) is a senior computer scientist in the Software
 Technology Lab at Adobe Systems, Inc. He has been developing
 software since 1985. Recent projects include a collaboration
 with [Alex Stepanov](http://www.stepanovpapers.com) on a programming class and work on
 the [Adobe Source Library](http://opensource.adobe.com/). Mat's first contribution
 to Boost came in the summer of 2000, when he discovered a way
 to exploit the properties of the sizeof operator to simulate
 partial specialization (is\_pointer, etc. with Jesse Jones). Mat
 lives in Seattle with his wife and son.
