Website 1.0 Launch

 After much work the new Boost web site is here. Like all software the site has
 bugs, so be gentle and reports problems in the bug tracker. Much thanks to the
 Boost community for the help in testing, criticizing, and writing. But I especially
 appreciate all the work Daniel James to translate content without which the web
 site would be a much emptier place.
