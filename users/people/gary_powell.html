Gary Powell
===========

![-](gary_powell.jpg) Gary
 Powell has been messing around with C++ since '87 when he
 dreamed about adding his own operators to the language. Since
 then he's been busy overloading everything in sight, and
 working on bringing functional programming to C++.


He currently works for Sierra On-line <http://www.sierra.com> a division of Havas
 Interactive, a wholly owned subsidiary of Vivedi Universal of
 France, <http://www.vivendi.com> as a game programmer
 where he writes AI.


He can be reached at [gary.powell@sierra.com](mailto:gary.powell@sierra.com) but don't ask him
 how to solve the riddle of the left handed troll.
