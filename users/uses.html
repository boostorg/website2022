Introduction
------------


Open source isn't just for nerds and researchers. Real world
 programming challenges, irrespective of whether they are open
 or closed source, can benefit enormously from the thought and
 experience that has gone into the Boost software libraries. Put
 simply, for any given problem for which Boost provides a
 solution, Boost will strive to provide the best solution
 possible. It's up to you to decide whether we've achieved that,
 but as these pages will testify, many other developers have
 found our solutions to be the best for them.


*Disclaimer:* Boost's developers try to ensure that
 the information on these pages is correct, but from time to
 time inadvertent mistakes are bound to occur: if you would like
 an entry in these pages to be removed or corrected please
 contact the [Boost
 Moderators](../community/moderators.html).


Submissions
-----------


If you have an application or library that's using Boost and
 would like to be listed here, please post the following
 information to the [main
 Boost developer mailing list](../community/groups.html#main):


* The name of the Application/Product/Service.
* The name of the company (where appropriate).
* A paragraph describing the
 Application/Product/Service.
* Any information you can provide about which parts of
 Boost you used, along with any comments you may have on how
 Boost helped your product development.
* URLs to your companies home page, and the home page of
 the Application/Product/Service if there is one.


Finally, if the subheadings used in the structure of these
 pages don't fit your Product/Application/Service please say so:
 we're always interested to hear how these pages can be improved
 or better structured.
