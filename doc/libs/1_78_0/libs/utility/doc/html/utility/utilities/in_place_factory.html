#### 
[Introduction](in_place_factory.html#utility.utilities.in_place_factory.introduction "Introduction")
 Suppose we have a class
 
```
struct X
{
  X ( int, [`std::string`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string) ) ;
};

```


 And a container for it which supports an empty state. That is, a container
 which can contain zero objects:
 
```
struct C
{
   C() : contained\_(0) {}
  ~C() { delete contained\_ ; }
  X\* contained\_ ;
};

```


 A container designed to support an empty state typically does not require
 the contained type to be [*DefaultConstructible*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/DefaultConstructible),
 but it typically requires it to be [*CopyConstructible*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/CopyConstructible)
 as a mechanism to initialize the object to store:
 
```
struct C
{
   C() : contained\_(0) {}
   C ( X const& v ) : contained\_ ( new X(v) ) {}
  ~C() { delete contained\_ ; }
  X\* contained\_ ;
};

```


 There is a subtle problem with this: since the mechanism used to initialize
 the stored object is copy construction, there must exist a previously constructed
 source object to copy from. This object is likely to be temporary and serve
 no purpose besides being the source:
 
```
void foo()
{
  // Temporary object created.
  C c( X(123,"hello") ) ;
}

```


 A solution to this problem is to support direct construction of the contained
 object right in the container's storage.
 
 In this scheme, the user supplies the arguments for the `X`
 constructor directly to the container:
 
```
struct C
{
   C() : contained\_(0) {}
   C ( X const& v ) : contained\_ ( new X(v) ) {}
   C ( int a0, [`std::string`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string) a1 ) : contained\_ ( new X(a0,a1) ) {}
  ~C() { delete contained\_ ; }
  X\* contained\_ ;
};

```


```
void foo()
{
  // Wrapped object constructed in-place
  // No temporary created.
  C c(123,"hello");
}

```


 Clearly, this solution does not scale well since the container must duplicate
 all the constructor overloads from the contained type, or at least all
 those which are to be supported directly in the container.
 

#### 
[Framework](in_place_factory.html#utility.utilities.in_place_factory.framework "Framework")
 This library proposes a framework to allow some containers to directly
 construct contained objects in-place without requiring the entire set of
 constructor overloads from the contained type. It also allows the container
 to remove the [*CopyConstructible*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/CopyConstructible)
 requirement from the contained type since objects can be directly constructed
 in-place without need of a copy.
 
 The only requirement on the container is that it must provide proper storage.
 That is, the container should be correctly aligned and sized. Naturally,
 the container will typically support uninitialized storage to avoid the
 in-place construction to override a fully-constructed object, as this would
 defeat the purpose of in-place construction.
 
 For this purpose, the framework provides two concepts called: InPlaceFactories
 and TypedInPlaceFactories. Helpers to declare these classes are declared
 in [`<boost/utility/in\_place\_factory.hpp>`](../../../../../../boost/utility/in_place_factory.hpp) and [`<boost/utility/typed\_in\_place\_factory.hpp>`](../../../../../../boost/utility/typed_in_place_factory.hpp).
 
 Essentially, these classes hold a sequence of actual parameters and a method
 to construct an object in place using these parameters. Each member of
 the family differs only in the number and type of the parameter list. The
 first family takes the type of the object to construct directly in method
 provided for that purpose, whereas the second family incorporates that
 type in the factory class itself. From the container point of view, using
 the framework amounts to calling the factory's method to contruct the object
 in place. From the user point of view, it amounts to creating the right
 factory object to hold the parameters and pass it to the container.
 
 The following simplified example shows the basic idea. A complete example
 follows the formal specification of the framework:
 
```
struct C
{
   template <class InPlaceFactory>
   C ( InPlaceFactory const& aFactory )
    :
    contained\_ ( uninitialized\_storage() )
   {
     aFactory.template apply<X>(contained\_);
   }

  ~C()
  {
    contained\_ -> X::~X();
    delete[] contained\_ ;
  }

  char\* uninitialized\_storage() { return new char[sizeof(X)] ; }

  char\* contained\_ ;
};

void foo()
{
  C c( in\_place(123,"hello") ) ;
}

```
#### 
[Specification](in_place_factory.html#utility.utilities.in_place_factory.specification "Specification")
 The following is the first member of the family of `InPlaceFactory`
 classes, along with its corresponding helper template function. The rest
 of the family varies only in the number and type of template and constructor
 parameters.
 
```
namespace boost {

struct [`in\_place\_factory\_base`](../../boost/in_place_factory_base.html "Class in_place_factory_base") {};

template<class A0>
class in\_place\_factory : public [`in\_place\_factory\_base`](../../boost/in_place_factory_base.html "Class in_place_factory_base")
{
  public:
    in\_place\_factory ( A0 const& a0 ) : m\_a0(a0) {}

    template< class T >
    void apply ( void\* address ) const
    {
      new (address) T(m\_a0);
    }

  private:
      A0 const& m\_a0 ;
};

template<class A0>
in\_place\_factory<A0> in\_place ( A0 const& a0 )
{
  return in\_place\_factory<A0>(a0);
}

}

```


 Similarly, the following is the first member of the family of `typed\_in\_place\_factory` classes, along
 with its corresponding helper template function. The rest of the family
 varies only in the number and type of template and constructor parameters.
 
```
namespace boost {

struct [`typed\_in\_place\_factory\_base`](in_place_factory.html#boost.typed_in_place_factory_base) {};

template<class T, class A0>
class typed\_in\_place\_factory : public [`typed\_in\_place\_factory\_base`](in_place_factory.html#boost.typed_in_place_factory_base)
{
  public:
    typed\_in\_place\_factory ( A0 const& a0 ) : m\_a0(a0) {}

    void apply ( void\* address ) const
    {
      new (address) T(m\_a0);
    }

  private:
    A0 const& m\_a0 ;
};

template<class T, class A0>
typed\_in\_place\_factory<A0> in\_place ( A0 const& a0 )
{
  return typed\_in\_place\_factory<T,A0>(a0);
}
}

```


 As you can see, the `in\_place\_factory`
 and `typed\_in\_place\_factory`
 template classes vary only in the way they specify the target type: in
 the first family, the type is given as a template argument to the apply
 member function while in the second it is given directly as part of the
 factory class.
 
 When the container holds a unique non-polymorphic type, such as the case
 of [Boost.Optional](../../../../../../libs/optional/index.html),
 it knows the exact dynamic-type of the contained object and can pass it
 to the `apply()`
 method of a non-typed factory. In this case, end users can use an `in\_place\_factory` instance which can be
 constructed without the type of the object to construct.
 
 However, if the container holds heterogeneous or polymorphic objects, such
 as the case of [Boost.Variant](../../../../../../libs/variant/index.html),
 the dynamic-type of the object to be constructed must be known by the factory.
 In this case, end users must use a `typed\_in\_place\_factory`
 instead.
 

#### 
[Container-side
 Usage](in_place_factory.html#utility.utilities.in_place_factory.container_side_usage "Container-side Usage")
 As shown in the introductory simplified example, the container class must
 contain methods that accept an instance of these factories and pass the
 object's storage to the factory's apply method.
 
 However, the type of the factory class cannot be completely specified in
 the container class because that would defeat the whole purpose of the
 factories which is to allow the container to accept a variadic argument
 list for the constructor of its contained object.
 
 The correct function overload must be based on the only distinctive and
 common characteristic of all the classes in each family: the base class.
 
 Depending on the container class, you can use `enable\_if`
 to generate the right overload, or use the following dispatch technique,
 which is used in the [Boost.Optional](../../../../../../libs/optional/index.html)
 class:
 
```
struct C
{
   C() : contained\_(0) {}
   C ( X const& v ) : contained\_ ( new X(v) ) {}

   template <class Expr>
   C ( Expr const& expr )
    :
    contained\_ ( uninitialized\_storage() )
   {
    construct(expr,&expr);
   }

  ~C() { delete contained\_ ; }

  template<class InPlaceFactory>
  void construct ( InPlaceFactory const& aFactory, boost::[`in\_place\_factory\_base`](../../boost/in_place_factory_base.html "Class in_place_factory_base")\* )
  {
    aFactory.template apply<X>(contained\_);
  }

  template<class TypedInPlaceFactory>
  void construct ( TypedInPlaceFactory const& aFactory, boost::[`typed\_in\_place\_factory\_base`](in_place_factory.html#boost.typed_in_place_factory_base)\* )
  {
    aFactory.apply(contained\_);
  }

  X\* uninitialized\_storage() { return static\_cast<X\*>(new char[sizeof(X)]) ; }

  X\* contained\_ ;
};

```
#### 
[User-side
 Usage](in_place_factory.html#utility.utilities.in_place_factory.user_side_usage "User-side Usage")
 End users pass to the container an instance of a factory object holding
 the actual parameters needed to construct the contained object directly
 within the container. For this, the helper template function `in\_place` is used.
 
 The call `in\_place(a0,a1,a2,...,an)` constructs
 a (non-typed) `in\_place\_factory`
 instance with the given argument list.
 
 The call `in\_place<T>(a0,a1,a2,...,an)` constructs
 a `typed\_in\_place\_factory`
 instance with the given argument list for the type `T`.
 
```
void foo()
{
  C a( in\_place(123, "hello") ) ;    // in\_place\_factory passed
  C b( in\_place<X>(456, "world") ) ; // typed\_in\_place\_factory passed
}

```
