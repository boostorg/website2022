### New Libraries


* [Describe](/libs/describe/): A C++14 reflection
 library, from Peter Dimov. Provides macros for describing enumerators and
 struct/class members, and primitives for querying this information.
* [Lambda2](/libs/lambda2/): A C++14, dependency-free,
 single header lambda library, from Peter Dimov. Allows simple function
 objects to be constructed via expressions such as `\_1
+ 5`,
 `\_1 %
2 == 0`, `\_1
> \_2`,
 or `\_1 ==
' ' || \_1 == '\t'`.

### Updated Libraries


* [Any](/libs/any/):

	+ Added `boost::anys::basic\_any` - a data type with customizable
	 Small Object Optimization whose instances can hold instances of any
	 type that satisfies ValueType requirements (many thanks to Ruslan
	 Arutyunyan @rarutyun). If you are not sure that you really need it,
	 then use `boost::any` instead.
	+ Started using GithubActions CI for additional testing
* [Asio](/libs/asio/):

	+ Added support for cancellation of individual asynchronous operations.
	+ Added the `associator`
	 trait, used to generically forward associators.
	+ Changed all asynchronous operations implemented in Asio to invoke
	 their completion handlers as rvalue references.
	+ Added support for asynchronous operations with multiple completion
	 signatures.
	+ Added `operator&&`
	 and `operator||`
	 for `awaitable<>`,
	 to allow coroutines to be trivially awaited in parallel.
	+ Added the `experimental::as\_tuple`
	 completion token adapter.
	+ Added the `experimental::append`
	 completion token adapter.
	+ Added the `experimental::prepend`
	 completion token adapter.
	+ Added the `experimental::deferred`
	 completion token, whicih allows deferred execution of asynchronous
	 operations.
	+ Added the `experimental::parallel\_group`
	 class and `experimental::make\_parallel\_group`
	 function.
	+ Added `experimental::promise`,
	 which allows eager execution and synchronisation of asynchronous
	 operations.
	+ Added the `experimental::coro`
	 class template, a C++20 coroutine primitive with the ability to combine
	 both asynchronous waiting (`co\_await`)
	 and yielding (`co\_yield`).
	+ Added move assignment to `ssl::stream<>`.
	+ Changed `co\_spawn`
	 to `dispatch` the coroutine's
	 initial step to the executor.
	+ Enabled additional optimisations for `any\_executor`
	 and `any\_io\_executor`
	 when used with asynchronous operations.
	+ Added the `nodiscard`
	 attribute to `awaitable<>`.
	+ Increased the number of cached slots in the default recycling allocator.
	+ Changed the default allocator behaviour to respect alignment requirements,
	 to support over-aligned types.
	+ Ensured the result strings are always initialised in reverse name
	 resolution.
	+ Fixed recursive template instantiation issues in `use\_awaitable\_t::executor\_with\_default`.
	+ Fixed the `any\_io\_executor`
	 equality operators to correctly return a result based on the target
	 executor.
	+ Fixed `strand<>`
	 to avoid using a potentially moved-from executor.
	+ Ensured gcc tests are not used for clang
	 when detecting compiler features.
	+ Disabled coroutines support for the clang shipped
	 with MSVC.
	+ Fixed compatibility with recent LibreSSL when `OPENSSL\_NO\_SSL\_INTERN`
	 is defined.
	+ Fixed `posix::basic\_stream\_descriptor` move operations
	 to work with non-defaulted executors.
	+ Consult the [Revision
	 History](/doc/libs/1_77_0/doc/html/boost_asio/history.html) for further details.
* [Atomic](/libs/atomic/):

	+ Added `make\_atomic\_ref`
	 and `make\_ipc\_atomic\_ref`
	 factory functions for constructing atomic reference objects.
	+ Added C++17 template argument deduction guides for `atomic\_ref` and `ipc\_atomic\_ref`
	 to allow omitting template arguments when they can be deduced from
	 constructor arguments.
* [Beast](/libs/beast/):

	+ This maintenance update brings minor bug fixes and updated CI reporting.
	+ We'd love to know how you or your company use Beast, consider adding
	 an entry to the [Companies
	 and Individuals Using Beast](https://github.com/boostorg/beast/wiki/Companies-and-Individuals-Using-Beast) list.
	+ See the full [Release
	 Notes](/libs/beast/doc/html/beast/release_notes.html) for a complete list of changes.
* [Conversion](/libs/conversion/):

	+ `boost::implicit\_cast` is now `constexpr` ([#25](https://github.com/boostorg/conversion/issues/25)).
	+ Fixed broken links ([PR#23](https://github.com/boostorg/conversion/pull/23)).
	+ Started using GithubActions CI for additional testing
* [Core](/libs/core/):

	+ `boost/core/uncaught\_exceptions.hpp` has been modified for compatibility
	 with Mac OS 10.4 and older. ([PR#92](https://github.com/boostorg/core/pull/92))
* [DLL](/libs/dll/):

	+ More runtime checks for malformed ELFs in `boost::dll::library\_info`
	+ In `boost::dll::library\_info` use info from `.dynsym`
	 ELF section if `.symtab`
	 is empty or missing
	+ List protected ELF symbols in `boost::dll::library\_info`
	 as they are available for import ([#50](https://github.com/boostorg/dll/issues/50))
	+ Remove unneeded convert from `wchar\_t`
	 to char on POSIX environment, thanks to Vladislav Shchapov ([PR#49](https://github.com/boostorg/dll/pull/49))
	+ Started using GithubAction CI for additional testing
* [Filesystem](/libs/filesystem/):

	+ **Introducing Boost.Filesystem v4.**
	 This new version of the library removes all deprecated features of
	 v3 and also makes a number of breaking API changes intended to make
	 Boost.Filesystem more compatible with std::filesystem introduced
	 in C++17. The differences are described in the release notes and
	 documentation using **v3** and **v4** tags and are also summarised in a separate
	 section. Users can select Boost.Filesystem version by defining `BOOST\_FILESYSTEM\_VERSION` macro
	 to either 3 or 4 when compiling their code. There is no need to separately
	 compile Boost.Filesystem for each library version - a single binary
	 supports both v3 and v4. Users should avoid using both v3 and v4
	 in the same application as this can lead to subtle bugs. Currently,
	 v3 is the default. In a future release v4 will become the default,
	 and eventually v3 will be removed. v4 is functional, but it is still
	 a work in progress and there may be breaking API changes in the future.
	+ **v4:** `path::filename`,
	 `path::stem` and `path::extension`
	 no longer consider root name or root directory of the path as a filename
	 if the path only consists of those components. For example, on Windows
	 `path("C:").filename()`
	 used to return "C:" and `path("C:\\").filename()` used to return "\" and
	 both will return an empty path now. ([#88](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/88), [#194](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/194))
	+ **v4:** `path::stem`
	 and `path::extension` no longer treat a filename
	 that starts with a dot and has no other dots as an extension. Filenames
	 starting with a dot are commonly treated as filenames with an empty
	 extension. The leading dot is used to indicate a hidden file on most
	 UNIX-like systems. ([#88](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/88))
	+ **New:** Improved support for various
	 path prefixes on Windows. Added support for local device prefix ("\\.\")
	 and experimental support for NT path prefix ("\??\"). The
	 prefixes will be included in the root name of a path. Note that using
	 the prefixes with Boost.Filesystem v3 can lead to surprising results
	 (e.g. `path("\\\\.\\").stem()
	== "\\\\"`).
	 It is recommended to use the prefixes only with Boost.Filesystem
	 v4.
	+ Reworked `path::lexically\_normal` implementation
	 to eliminate some cases of duplicate dot (".") elements
	 in the normalized paths.
	+ **New:** Added runtime detection of
	 the `statx` and `getrandom` system calls on Linux.
	 This can be useful if the syscall is present at compile time but
	 fails with `ENOSYS`
	 at run time (for example, in Docker containers that restrict the
	 syscall, even if available on the host). ([#172](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/172))
	+ **New:** Added support for disabling
	 usage of various system APIs at library build time. This can be useful
	 when a certain API is detected as present by the library configuration
	 scripts but must not be used for some reason (for example, when runtime
	 detection does not work on the target system). See the description
	 of configuration macros in the library documentationfor for more
	 details.
	+ **New:** Added `copy\_options::synchronize\_data`
	 and `copy\_options::synchronize`
	 options for the `copy\_file`
	 operation. These options allow to synchronize the written data and
	 attributes with the permanent storage. These options are expensive
	 in terms of performance, but allow to ensure reliability of the copied
	 data. Note that `copy\_file`
	 performed implicit data synchronization on POSIX systems since Boost.Filesystem
	 1.74.0. This release adds support for more platforms and disables
	 data synchronization by default while allowing the caller to explicitly
	 request it. ([#186](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/186))
	+ Added handling of `EINTR`
	 error code on POSIX systems for some system calls issued internally.
	 In particular, `EINTR`
	 could have been ignored on `close`,
	 which on HP-UX would result in a leaked file descriptor.
	+ In the `copy\_file`
	 implementations based on Linux `sendfile`
	 and `copy\_file\_range`
	 system calls, added handling of error codes indicating that a particular
	 filesystem does not support the system call and fall back to the
	 generic `read`/`write` loop. This should fix `copy\_file` failing on [eCryptFS](https://www.ecryptfs.org/)
	 and possibly other filesystems. ([#184](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/184))
	+ The `copy\_file\_range`
	 system call is now used since Linux kernel 4.5, whereas previously
	 it was only enabled since 5.3. The `copy\_file`
	 implementation will fall back to `sendfile`
	 or `read`/`write` loop if `copy\_file\_range`
	 fails to copy a given file across filesystems.
	+ The `copy\_file` implementations
	 based on Linux `sendfile`
	 and `copy\_file\_range`
	 system calls will not be used on filesystems that are known to contain
	 files with generated content. These system calls are incompatible
	 with such files, and copying them would result in zero-sized files.
	 The generic `read`/`write` loop will be used instead.
	 Currently, the blacklisted filesystems are: procfs, sysfs, tracefs
	 and debugfs.
	+ In the `copy\_file`
	 implementation based on `read`/`write` loop, increased the maximum
	 size of the buffer used for temporary storage and take into account
	 the target filesystem block size for more optimal performance.
	+ On Windows CE, calling `current\_path`
	 to obtain the current path for a process will now fail with an error
	 instead of returning successfully with a root path. This platform
	 does not support current directory. Changing the current path was
	 already failing similarly in previous releases of Boost.Filesystem.
	+ In `canonical`, fixed
	 the check for a symlink referencing a directory above root, if an
	 earlier symlink was resolved to an absolute path with a different
	 root from the original path.
	+ In `canonical`, added
	 a limit for the maximum number of symlinks that can be resolved during
	 the call. The limit is currently at least 40 symlinks.
	+ On Windows, `canonical`
	 and `weakly\_canonical`
	 will now use `path::preferred\_separator`
	 for the root directory separator in the resulting paths. This fixes
	 "file not found" errors caused by Windows API not handling
	 generic separators in UNC paths and paths that start with the Win32
	 filesystem prefix ("\\?\"). ([#87](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/87), [#187](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/187))
	+ **New:** Added `weakly\_canonical`
	 overloads taking `base`
	 path as an argument.
	+ On Windows, `weakly\_canonical`
	 no longer fails with an error if the input path contains elements
	 that do not exist in the filesystem but are cancelled by a subsequent
	 dot-dot ("..") element. For example, `weakly\_canonical("C:\\a\\..")` would previously fail if "C:\a"
	 directory did not exist. ([#201](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/201))
	+ In `read\_symlink` on
	 Windows, corrected reparse point handling. The operation would return
	 an empty path for some mount points (for example, created by [Box](https://www.box.com/) cloud storage driver) and
	 directory junction points that had empty print names. The new implementation
	 now parses substitute name of the reparse point and attempts to reconstruct
	 a Win32 path from it. ([#187](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/187))
	+ On Windows, file streams provided in `boost/filesystem/fstream.hpp`
	 will use wide character paths on libc++ versions 7.0 and higher,
	 when the standard library supports opening files with wide character
	 paths. ([#181](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/181))
	+ On Windows, creating symlinks should no longer require elevated privileges,
	 if Windows is configured in [Developer
	 mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development).
	+ With some compilers, global objects used internally in Boost.Filesystem
	 are now destroyed after user's global destructors are called. This
	 allows to call Boost.Filesystem methods during the program termination
	 stage. In particular, this concerns the path locale that is used
	 for character code conversion and can be installed by calling `path::imbue`. The supported compilers
	 include MSVC, GCC and Clang, as well as other compilers that support
	 customizing program initialization order through `#pragma
	section` (for MSVC-compatible
	 compilers) or `\_\_attribute\_\_
	((init\_priority))` (for GCC-compatible compilers).

* [JSON](/libs/json/):

	+ `value\_to` supports
	 `TupleLike` types.
	+ `value\_to` and `value\_from` support `std::array` and similar types.
	+ Implicit conversion operator from `string`
	 to `std::string\_view`.
	+ `std::hash` specializations for json types.
	+ Fixed allocation errors in `object`
	 and `key\_value\_pair`.
	+ Fixed crash when constructing `array`
	 from a pair of iterators that form an empty range.
* [LexicalCast](/libs/lexical_cast/):

	+ Fixed assignment to an int of a floating point value that is out
	 of representable range for int.
	+ Started using GithubActions CI for additional testing
* [Log](/libs/log/):

	+ Fixed compilation for riscv32 target. ([PR#150](https://github.com/boostorg/log/pull/150))
* [Mp11](/libs/mp11/):

	+ Added `mp\_intersperse`,
	 `mp\_split`, `mp\_join`
* [Multi-index Containers](/libs/multi_index/):

	+ Maintenance work.
* [Nowide](/libs/nowide/):

	+ Allow for usage of `iostream`
	 classes before `main`
	 (best effort, works for most environments)
	+ Fix initialization of `rdbuf`
	 in `cin/cout/cerr` for redirected input/output
	+ Fix corner case in `cin::unget()` after using `putback()`
	+ Fix possibly delayed `close`
	 of `filebuf` after
	 move assignment
	+ Improve performance of `utf8\_codecvt`
* [PFR](/libs/pfr/):

	+ A MurMur Hash based implementation of hash\_combine() is now used
	 to reduce collisions count and improve quality of `boost::pfr::hash\_value()`
	+ Visual Studio 2017 now supported in C++14 mode (thanks to Denis Mikhailov
	 aka @denzor200)
	+ Issues found by inspect tool were fixed
	+ Fixed some warnings, including removal of extra semicolons in include/boost/pfr/detail/fields\_count.hpp
	 ([#72](https://github.com/boostorg/pfr/issues/72))
	+ Added a compile time assert for inherited types (thanks to Denis
	 Mikhailov aka @denzor200)
	+ Reflection of aggregates with non movable fields is now possible
	 if guaranteed copy elision is on
	+ Fixed spelling issues
	+ Started using GithubActions CI for additional testing
* [PropertyTree](/libs/property_tree/):

	+ This is a maintenance release.
	+ Extend compiler coverage in CI.
	+ Fix Boost compatibility for CMakeLists.txt.
* [System](/libs/system/):

	+ The conversion operator from `error\_category`
	 to `std::error\_category` has been improved
	 and no longer requires `<map>`
	 or `<mutex>`.
	+ The comparison operators of `error\_category`
	 are now inline friends instead of member functions (a side effect
	 of the previous change.)
	+ `error\_condition` now
	 defers calling `generic\_category()` to avoid instantiating the object
	 until it's actually needed.
	+ `error\_condition::failed` and `error\_condition::message`
	 have been undeprecated, and `operator
	bool()`
	 now once again returns `failed()`.
	+ The system category now doesn't call `generic\_category()`, to avoid instantiating the object.
	+ The return value of `default\_error\_condition`
	 changes in some cases into an `error\_condition`
	 from the generic category, instead of from the system category. This
	 happens on POSIX when the input `error\_code`
	 is from the system category and does not correspond to any `errc\_t` value.
	+ The interoperability of `error\_code`
	 and `std::error\_code` has been improved substantially.
	 It is now possible to construct `boost::system::error\_code`
	 from `std::error\_code`, and it's possible to
	 pass `boost::system::error\_code` to functions taking
	 `std::error\_code&`.
	+ A stream insertion operator for `error\_condition`
	 has been added.
* [Uuid](/libs/uuid/):

	+ Added `to\_chars` for
	 writing uuid strings without allocating ([PR#116](https://github.com/boostorg/uuid/pull/116))
