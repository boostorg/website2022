Boost Formal Review Schedule



Boost Formal Review Schedule
============================

Reviews are scheduled when the review wizards approve a
 review manager and agree with the manager and author on dates.
 See [Formal Review Process](reviews.html) for more
 information.


In addition to upcoming reviews, the schedule includes
 recent reviews already completed; that helps track review
 manager assignments and libraries reviewed but not yet posted
 on the website. There is often a lag between acceptance and
 site posting as authors address issues raised in the formal
 review.
