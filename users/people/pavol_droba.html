![-](pavol_droba.jpg) Pavol
 Droba lives in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia with his
 beautiful wife Lenka.


Since childhood he has always been messing with computers in
 one way or the other until he settled down with C++. Since then
 he did a lot of various projects but he retained his affinity
 to his favorite programming language.


He loves to design nice programs that works and to see how
 the pieces of the puzzle called design come together.


Currently he is a developer in a small company where he
 leads a group of 5 other guys.


When he is not at the computer Pavol enjoys his time with
 his wife. In winter he likes skiing, in summer he does some
 scuba diving.


You can leave him a message at [droba@topmail.sk](mailto:droba@topmail.sk).
