[Download this release.](http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-jam/3.1.18/)


 After years of bjam developments.. This is going to be the last unbundled release
 of the 3.1.x series. From this point forward bjam will only be bundled as part
 of the larger Boost Build system. And hence will likely change name at some point.
 As a side effect of this move people will get more frequent release of bjam (or
 whatever it ends up being called).
