### Known Issues
 These are patches from library authors which were found too late to be fixed
 in the release.
 


* Boost.Filesystem directory iterators may fail to construct for a network
 share on Windows prior to 10, see [PR#246](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/pull/246) and [#245](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/245).
 [Patch](/patches/1_80_0/0001-filesystem-win-fix-dir-it-net-share.patch).
* In Boost.Filesystem on Windows, `weakly\_canonical`
 fails to process paths that start with the "\\?\" prefix, see
 [#247](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/247). [Patch](/patches/1_80_0/0002-filesystem-fix-weakly-canonical-long-paths.patch).

### New Libraries


* No new libraries.

### Updated Libraries


* [Asio](/libs/asio/):

	+ Added a deduced trailing return type to all asynchronous operations,
	 to enable the new form of `async\_result`
	 for C++11.
	+ Moved `append`, `prepend`, `as\_tuple`,
	 and `deferred` to the
	 `boost::asio` namespace, and made them compatible
	 with C++11.
	+ Made `experimental::parallel\_group`
	 compatible with C++11.
	+ Added `buffer()`
	 overloads for contiguous containers, such as `std::span`.
	+ Added the ability for `awaitable<>`-based coroutines to directly
	 `co\_await` operations
	 that are packaged as function objects.
	+ Changed `spawn()`
	 to be a completion token-based asynchronous operation, and added
	 support for cancellation. The `basic\_yield\_context`
	 token now supports move-only and variadic result types. When targeting
	 C++11 and later, `spawn()` and `basic\_yield\_context`
	 are implemented in terms of Boost.Context directly.
	+ Added the `is\_async\_operation`
	 trait and `async\_operation`
	 concept.
	+ Added the `completion\_signature\_of`
	 trait.
	+ Added converting move construction/assignment to posix descriptors,
	 serial ports, pipes, Windows `object\_handle`,
	 Windows stream handles, and Windows random-access handles.
	+ Added `release()`
	 member functions to pipes, Windows stream handles, and Windows random-access
	 handles.
	+ Enabled support for `Endpoint`
	 implementations that return `void`
	 pointers from their `data()` member functions, as per the documented
	 `Endpoint` type requirements.
	+ Removed `all()`
	 and `race()`
	 from `experimental::promise`,
	 as `experimental::parallel\_group` covers this functionality.
	+ Added source locations to exceptions and error codes produced by
	 the synchronous and asynchronous operations.
	+ Fixed compatibility with OpenSSL 3.0.4 and later.
	+ Fixed compatibility with with -masm=intel.
	+ Explicitly stated that socket `shutdown()` calls are thread-safe with respect
	 to certain other synchronous operations on the same socket.
	+ Optimised the move construction of I/O objects where only the executor
	 type differs.
	+ Fixed the detection of `std::invoke\_result`
	 for clang/libc++.
	+ Fixed an issue where `experimental::parallel\_group`
	 initiation incorrectly moved arguments instead of forwarding them.
	+ Fixed a sequencing issue in the implementation of `post()`, `dispatch()`, and `defer()`.
	+ Fixed the `awaitable<>` implementation to propagate
	 exceptions from awaited initiation functions through the current
	 completion handler.
	+ Fixed detection of `std::aligned\_alloc`
	 with gcc 7.
	+ Changed to avoid using the soon-to-be-deprecated `std::aligned\_storage`
	 on newer compilers.
	+ Fixed detection of `std::aligned\_alloc`
	 for older Apple platforms.
	+ Removed faulty assertions from `experimental::coro`
	 implementation.
	+ Added defence against Qt-defined macros when building with Intel
	 C++.
	+ Changed the implementation of the `select\_reactor`,
	 on Windows, to ensure that any exception resulting from failure to
	 recreate its interrupter's sockets will be allowed to propagate out
	 through `io\_context::run()`.
	+ Fixed various compiler warnings.
	+ Updated all composed operations examples, and the C++11 timeouts
	 example, to use the new `async\_result`
	 form.
	+ Added composed operation and coroutine examples for C++20.
	+ Consult the [Revision
	 History](/doc/libs/1_80_0/doc/html/boost_asio/history.html) for further details.
* [Atomic](/libs/atomic/):

	+ Improved portability of endianness checks on ARM, AArch32 and AArch64
	 targets. ([#59](https://github.com/boostorg/atomic/issues/59))
	+ Fixed compilation with MSVC 14.0 (Visual Studio 2015) in C++17 mode.
	 ([#61](https://github.com/boostorg/atomic/issues/61))
* [Filesystem](/libs/filesystem/):

	+ On Windows, added a fallback implementation for querying file attributes
	 in case if the file cannot be opened with `ERROR\_ACCESS\_DENIED`
	 error. This may allow `status`
	 and `symlink\_status`
	 to succeed for system files and directories that are not reparse
	 points or symlinks. ([#234](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/234))
	+ On Windows, added a workaround for FAT/exFAT filesystems that produce
	 `ERROR\_INVALID\_PARAMETER`
	 when querying file attributes. This affected `status`
	 and `symlink\_status`,
	 which reported that files do not exist, and directory iterators,
	 which failed to construct, as well as other dependent operations.
	 ([#236](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/236), [#237](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/237))
	+ Worked around a compilation problem on [RTEMS](https://www.rtems.org/).
	 ([PR#240](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/pull/240))
	+ On Linux, corrected switching to `sendfile`
	`copy\_file` implementation
	 if `copy\_file\_range`
	 failed with `ENOSYS`
	 in runtime. The `sendfile`
	 fallback implementation used to skip the filesystem type check and
	 could fail for some filesystems.
	+ On POSIX systems supporting `openat`
	 and related APIs defined in POSIX.1-2008 and on Windows Vista and
	 later, improved protection of `remove\_all`
	 against [CVE-2022-21658](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21658)
	 that was implemented in the previous release. The previous fix could
	 still result in removing unintended files in [certain
	 conditions](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/224#issuecomment-1183738097). Other systems remain vulnerable.
* [GIL](/libs/gil/):
**NOTICE:**
 We are planning BREAKING switch to C++17 as minimum required C++ language
 version in one or two releases after Boost 1.80 ([#676](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/issues/676))
 
	+ Added
	 
		- GSoC 2020: Added Perona-Malik anisotropic diffusion algorithm
		 ([PR#500](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/500))
		- GSoC 2020: Added histogram class and related functionality
		 ([PR#499](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/499))
		- GSoC 2020: Added histogram equalization feature ([PR#514](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/514))
		- GSoC 2020: Added histogram matching algorithm ([PR#515](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/515))
		- GSoC 2020: Added ability to stack images either horizontally
		 (`hstack`) or
		 vertically (`vstack`)
		 ([PR#506](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/506))
		- GSoC 2020: Added adaptive histogram equalization algorithm
		 ([PR#516](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/516))
		- GSoC 2020: Added Standard Hough Transform and circle rasterization
		 ([PR#512](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/512))
		- GSoC 2020: Added Bresenham's algorithm for line rasterization
		 ([PR#512](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/512))
		- GSoC 2021: Added rotation of image by arbitrary angle around
		 its center ([PR#565](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/565))
		- GSoC 2021: Added rasterization support for ellipse based on
		 "An Efficient Ellipse-Drawing Algorithm" by Jerry
		 Van Aken ([PR#585](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/585))
		- Added `image`
		 constructor from compatible view ([PR#520](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/520))
		- Added inverse function for affine `matrix3x2`
		 ([PR#527](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/527))
		- Added standard morphological transformations ([PR#541](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/541))
		- Added `for\_each\_pixel`
		 overload for `any\_image`
		 ([PR#648](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/648))
		- Added C++17 polymorphic memory resource typedefs for `image` class ([PR#529](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/529))
	+ Changed
	 
		- **BREAKING:** The required minimum
		 C++ version is changed from from C++11 to C++14. Currently,
		 large parts of GIL still compile with a C++11 compiler. However,
		 there is no guarantee that it stays that way, and any compilers
		 that do not support at least C++14 are considered unsupported
		 as of now.
		- **BREAKING:** `any\_color\_converted\_view()` is deprecated and will be
		 removed in the next release. Use `color\_converted\_view()` instead, which provides the
		 same feature.
		- **BREAKING:** `apply\_operation`
		 for `any\_image`
		 is deprecated and will be removed in the next release. Use
		 `variant2::visit` instead, which provides
		 the same feature. ([PR#656](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/656))
		- Moved numeric extension to core ([PR#573](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/573))
		- Added support for C++17's `<filesystem>`
		 ([PR#636](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/636)) The availability of the `std::filesystem`
		 is detected automatically, unless the `BOOST\_GIL\_IO\_USE\_BOOST\_FILESYSTEM`
		 macro is defined that forces the preference of the Boost.Filesystem.
		- Renamed `pixel\_multiply\_t`
		 to `pixel\_multiplies\_t`
		 and `pixel\_divide\_t`
		 to `pixel\_divides\_t`
		 ([PR#655](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/655))
		- Renamed `io/dynamic\_io\_new.hpp`
		 to `io/detail/dynamic.hpp` ([PR#653](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/653))
		- Moved function `construct\_matched`
		 into `boost::gil::detail`
		 namespace as it was only used by other implementation details
		 ([PR#653](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/653))
		- Made `packed\_pixel`
		 trivially copyable and assignable ([PR#679](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/679))
		- Replace deprecated libtiff v4.3 typedefs with C99 fixed-size
		 integers ([PR#685](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/685))
	+ Removed
	 
		- **BREAKING:** Removed support
		 for GCC 5 ([PR#572](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/572))
		- Removed deprecated.hpp ([PR#627](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/627))
	+ Fixed
	 
		- Fixed conversion from RGB to HSL ([PR#505](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/505))
		- Fixed conversion from RGB to signed CMYK ([PR#522](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/522))
		- Removed unnecessary numeric cast in hsv.hpp ([PR#530](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/530))
		- Fixed default constructor for `homogeneous\_color\_base`
		 for reference pixel elements ([PR#542](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/542))
		- Fixed returning reference to local temporary object in `subchroma\_image\_view` ([PR#556](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/556))
		- Added missing header guards in diffusion.hpp ([PR#568](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/568))
		- Fixed `any\_image\_view<>::const\_t`
		 ([PR#526](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/526))
		- Fixed C++20 incompatibilities in I/O extensions ([PR#617](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/617))
		- Ensured all examples build without errors ([PR#628](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/628))
		- Fixed `convolve\_2d`
		 for images with `float32\_t`
		 channel model ([PR#577](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/577))
		- Fixed `for\_each\_pixel`
		 for non-1d iterable views ([PR#621](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/621))
		- Fixed: `is\_equal\_to\_sixteen`
		 in PNG I/O was less-than test ([PR#650](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/650))
		- Re-allow `devicen\_t`
		 with two components ([PR#654](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/654)) It was unintentionally removed
		 in Boost 1.72
		- Fixed memory leak in `image`
		 class for empty dimensions ([PR#649](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/649))

* [Histogram](/libs/histogram/):

	+ Fixed segfault in `indexed`
	 when trying to iterate over histogram with axes of zero size (physical
	 or logical) under certain conditions
	+ Removed previously deprecated API
	 
		- class `accumulators::thread\_safe`:
		 use `accumulators::count<T, true>`
		- Methods `accumulators::sum::large`
		 and `accumulators::sum::small`:
		 use `accumulators::sum::large\_part`
		 and `accumulators::sum::small\_part`
		- Type alias `algorithm::reduce\_option`:
		 use `algorithm::reduce\_command`
		- Template function `axis::traits::static\_options`:
		 use `axis::traits::get\_options`
		- Template function `axis::traits::static\_is\_inclusive`:
		 use `axis::traits::is\_inclusive`
		- Type alias `indexed::range\_iterator`:
		 use `indexed::iterator`
		- Type alias `indexed::accessor::reference`:
		 use `indexed::accessor::const\_reference`
* [Iterator](/libs/iterator/):

	+ For C++11 and later, added support for perfect forwarding of values
	 written to `function\_output\_iterator`.
	 ([PR#73](https://github.com/boostorg/iterator/pull/73))
	+ Added protection against writing to `function\_output\_iterator`
	 a result of dereferencing another `function\_output\_iterator`.
* [JSON](/libs/json/):

	+ Added non-const `value::at`
	 overloads.
	+ Added the ability to manually choose endianness of the platform.
	+ Added `string::subview()`
	 overload.
	+ Fixed segfault in `array::erase(it)`.
	+ Fixed low performance of `serialize`
	 on libc++.
	+ Fixed ambigious conversion to `std::string\_view`
	 on GCC 8.
	+ Fixed parsing on big-endian platforms.
	+ Fixed handling of comment after trailing comma.
* [LEAF](/libs/leaf/):

	+ API breaking change: throw leaf::exception(....) now becomes leaf::throw\_exception(....)
	+ Fixed a bug in support for a rare build configuration (exception
	 handling enabled, diagnostics disabled)
	+ Using nullptr instead of 0 throughout
	+ Fixed pedantic warnings
* [Locale](/libs/locale/):

	+ Deprecated support for C++03 and earlier, C++11 will be required
	 in the next release
	+ Provide `-sICU\_LINK\_LOCALE`
	 as a temporary replacement for `-sICU\_LINK` which is incompatible
	 with Boost.Regex. `-sICU\_LINK\_LOCALE` and `-sICU\_LINK`
	 are deprecated and will be replaced by `ICU\_\*\_NAME`
	 options to be compatible with Boost.Regex
	+ Fix UB/assertion failure in the ICU `collator`
	 implementation when transforming empty strings
	+ Fix some issues related to visibility of classes in shared libraries
	 (Unix only)
	+ Fix compatibility with C++20 mode
	+ Fix compatibility with `BOOST\_USE\_WINDOWS\_H`
	+ Fix build failures due to missing includes
	+ Handle or suppress many warnings which makes the build log cleaner
* [Log](/libs/log/):

	+ Bug fixes:
	 
		- Fixed binding incorrect local address in UDP socket-based
		 `syslog\_backend`
		 when IPv6 address is used for the syslog server. ([#181](https://github.com/boostorg/log/issues/181))
		- Added a workaround for a [bug](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=105857)
		 in libstdc++ from gcc 11.2. When `max\_size\_decor`
		 was used on a formatting stream, `std::codecvt::do\_length`
		 incorrectly accessed the input buffer and caused a buffer overflow.
	+ See [changelog](/libs/log/doc/html/log/changelog.html)
	 for more details.
* [Math](/libs/math/):

	+ **Deprecated C++11 support**: from 2023
	 we will require C++14 as a minimum standard. This will mean GCC-5
	 or MSVC-14.1 as a minimal requirement.
	+ Add `constexpr` fma support,
	 see [734](https://github.com/boostorg/math/pull/734).
	+ Add support for the Chatterjee Correlation Coefficient, see [770](https://github.com/boostorg/math/pull/770).
	+ Added support for the logarithm of the PDF for all the distributions.
	+ Improve support for building with no exception or RTTI support.
	+ Some minor bug fixes for [sub 1]F[sub 1] corner cases, see [778](https://github.com/boostorg/math/pull/778).
* [Multiprecision](/libs/multiprecision/):

	+ **Mark C++11 support as deprecated**:
	 from 2023 we will move to requiring C++14 as a minimum standard level.
	 That will drop support for GCC versions prior to 5 and MSVC prior
	 to 14.1.
	+ Fix conflict between `boost/cstdfloat.hpp`
	 and this library.
	+ Clean up lots of gcc and clang warnings.
	+ Fix input streaming of composite types (complex, interval rational)
	 where there is a trailing delimeter in the stream and no whitespace.
	+ Fix `constexpr` integer
	 square root where the input is 1, 2 or 3.
	+ Add missing `#include`
	 of `<memory>` to float128.hpp.
	+ Correct 2-arg constructor for class `number`
	 to prevent ambiguity in some cases.
	+ Correct and make more consistent behaviour of divide-by-zero in gmp.hpp.
* [Multi-index Containers](/libs/multi_index/):

	+ Maintenance work.
* [Nowide](/libs/nowide/):

	+ Major performance improvement for Bulk I/O with files
	+ `basic\_filebuf`: Fix
	 wrong return value of `sync`
	 when `fflush` failed
	+ `basic\_filebuf`: Fix
	 possible undefined behavior in a corner case when nothing was actually
	 written but buffer is in "write" mode
	+ `basic\_filebuf`: Limit
	 putback of characters (i.e. `pbackfail`)
	 only allowing putback of buffered characters (may be only 1 character)
* [Optional](/libs/optional/):

	+ Added specializations for `std::hash<boost::optional<T>>`. This is a breaking change
	 for programs that define such specializations themselves. For more
	 details see [specs](/libs/optional/doc/html/boost_optional/reference/header__boost_optional_optional_hpp_/detailed_semantics___std__hash_specializations.html#reference_std_hash_spec).
* [STLInterfaces](/libs/stl_interfaces/):

	+ Fix [#53](https://github.com/boostorg/stl_interfaces/issues/53): "missing 'typename' prior to dependent
	 type name 'C::const\_iterator'"
	+ Fix [#54](https://github.com/boostorg/stl_interfaces/issues/54): "Concept check fails on .data() of
	 a view on contiguous iterator\_interface instantiations"
	+ New additions to make it easy to write views and view adaptors that
	 work like, and interoperate with, the ones in the standard library:
	 
		- Add workalikes for C++23's `std::bind\_back()` and `std::range\_adaptor\_closure`
		 for pre-C++23 code.
		- Add templates `closure`
		 and `adaptor`
		 to make writing view adaptors easier, following the examples
		 in [P2387](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p2387r3.html).
* [System](/libs/system/):

	+ When an `error\_code`
	 is converted to `std::error\_code`
	 and then back to `error\_code`,
	 the original is now restored, if possible.
	+ Reworked the conversion from `error\_category`
	 to `std::error\_category` to avoid the one-time
	 allocation that shows up on leak checkers.
	+ Added a constructor that allows replacing the source location of
	 an `error\_code`, and
	 a corresponding `assign`.
	+ Added a converting constructor to `result`.
* [Unordered](/libs/unordered/):
 Major update:
 
	+ [Refactor](/libs/unordered/doc/html/unordered.html#buckets_fast_closed_addressing_implementation)
	 internal implementation to be dramatically faster
	+ Allow `final` `Hasher` and `KeyEqual`
	 objects
	+ Update documentation, adding benchmark graphs and notes on the new
	 internal data structures
* [Utility](/libs/utility/):

	+ In `string\_view`/`string\_ref`, fixed `max\_size` returning incorrect value.
	 ([#91](https://github.com/boostorg/utility/issues/91))
	+ Removed `noexcept` specifier
	 from `string\_view::compare`
	 as it may throw on some input arguments. ([#94](https://github.com/boostorg/utility/issues/94))
	+ In `string\_view`/`string\_ref`, added support for calling
	 `substr` with no arguments.
	 ([#96](https://github.com/boostorg/utility/issues/96))
	+ Added `string\_view::contains`
	 methods that were introduced in C++23. ([#93](https://github.com/boostorg/utility/issues/93))
	+ In `string\_view`, added
	 asserts in `remove\_prefix`/`remove\_suffix` methods to enforce
	 the precondition that the prefix/suffix length does not exceed the
	 string view size. The previous (undocumented) behavior of silently
	 clamping the prefix/suffix length is deprecated and will be removed
	 in a future release. ([#92](https://github.com/boostorg/utility/issues/92))
* [Wave](/libs/wave/):
 Fixed bugs:
 
	+ [#24](https://github.com/boostorg/wave/issues/24): Line numbers wrong after conditional section
	+ [#160](https://github.com/boostorg/wave/issues/160): one test fails with error C2660 and error C2440 under
	 msvc /permissive- mode
	+ [#161](https://github.com/boostorg/wave/issues/161): BOOST\_WAVE\_THROW\_NAME\_CTX does not result in a context
	 callback and always throws
	+ [#162](https://github.com/boostorg/wave/issues/162): When Boost headers are included in the preprocessed
	 translation unit, Wave fails in boost/integer.hpp(99)

### Updated Tools
