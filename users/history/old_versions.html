Old Versions
------------


December 14th, 1999 12:00 GMT


### 14 Dec 1999
[Operators.hpp](/boost/operators.hpp) [documentation](/libs/utility/operators.htm)
 improved.
 

### 13 Dec 1999
 Added iterator operators and helpers to [header
 operators.hpp](/libs/utility/operators.htm), together with an iterator test program. This header
 is maturing into something really useful for building arithmetic or iterator
 user-defined types, so look it over even if you browsed one of the earlier
 versions.
 

### 11 Dec 1999
 Added next() and prior() to [header utility.hpp](/libs/utility/utility.htm).
 

### 8 Dec 1999
 Minor improvements to the [smart pointer](/libs/smart_ptr/index.html)
 library: `operator ==`,
 `operator !=`,
 and specializations for `std::swap` and
 `std::less` now provided.
 

### 18 Nov 1999
 Minor improvements made to the [Operator
 templates](/libs/utility/operators.htm).
 

### 15 Nov 1999
[Operator templates](/libs/utility/operators.htm) have been
 added to the [utility](/libs/utility/index.html) library.
 

### 11 Oct 1999
 Minor [smart pointer](/libs/smart_ptr/index.html) library
 and [config.hpp](/boost/config.hpp) changes to improve portability.
 

### 26 Sep 1999
 Minor updates to several libraries: \* `polymorphic\_downcast<>` in the [utility](/libs/utility/index.html)
 library [cast.hpp](/boost/cast.hpp) header now works for
 multiple inheritance cases. \* `shared\_ptr<>` and `shared\_array<>` `swap()` functions added in the [smart
 pointer](/libs/smart_ptr/index.html) library. \* [timer.hpp](/boost/timer.hpp) `elapsed\_max()`
 and `elapsed\_min()`
 functions added to the [timer](/libs/timer/index.html) library.
 \* [integer](/libs/integer/index.html) library bin\_ubin.hpp
 changes to eliminate compiler warning messages. \* [config.hpp](/boost/config.hpp)
 minor changes to aid library developers. No impact on library users.
 

### 3 Sep 1999
 The cast functions in the [utility](/libs/utility/index.html)
 library were considerably simplified.
 

### 1 Sep 1999
 The cast functions initially in [utility.hpp](/boost/utility.hpp)
 have been moved to [cast.hpp](/boost/cast.hpp), still in
 the [utility](/libs/utility/index.html) library.
 

### 1 Sep 1999
 The category "Experimental" has been added to the [library](/libs/libraries.htm)
 page. The [integer](/libs/integer/index.html) library is
 the first entry.
 

 ...And the remainder are lost to the mists of time (for now, anyway)....
