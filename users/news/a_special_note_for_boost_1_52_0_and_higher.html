A Special Note for Boost 1.52.0 and Higher


 



A Special Note for Boost 1.52.0 and Higher
==========================================

A Special Note for Boost 1.52.0 and Higher
------------------------------------------


November 6th, 2012 09:27 GMT


 Starting with Boost 1.52.0, the `boost::result\_of`
 component defaults to an implementation that uses the C++11 `decltype`
 keyword to deduce the return type of callables on compilers with strong `decltype` support. As `boost::result\_of`
 is a key piece of library infrastructure, we at Boost have found this change
 to be moderately disruptive. You should be aware of the issue when making the
 decision to upgrade from an older version of Boost.
 
### Why
 the Change Was Made
`boost::result\_of` has been changed to use `decltype` to make it more consistent with `std::result\_of`
 (when sufficient compiler support is available). Also, the use of `decltype` should help to improve compile times
 and increase the accuracy of the type computation.
 

### Who
 is Affected
 If you use a compiler with sufficiently bug-free `decltype`
 support (including [N3276](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3276.pdf)),
 then you will get the new behavior. At the time of writing (Nov 4, 2012), the
 only compiler in that category is Clang 3.1, but as other compilers improve,
 this will change.
 

### What
 Problems Can the Change Cause?
 The use of `decltype` in `result\_of` can result in a different type
 being computed than with the now-obsolete TR1 `result\_of`
 protocol. This will often be the case for incorrectly written TR1-style function
 objects that misreport their result types. This is unfortunately too common.
 But it can even happen for some correctly written function objects.
 

### Where
 Can I Learn More?
 Please see the documentation for [`boost::result\_of`](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_52_0/libs/utility/utility.htm#result_of)
 to understand the differences between TR1 `result\_of`
 and `decltype` `result\_of`,
 and to find out how you can write your code to accommodate both.
