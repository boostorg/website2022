Andreas Huber
=============

![-](andreas_huber.jpg)
 Andreas Huber is currently on a parental leave. At former
 companies Andreas has been developing systems ranging from PC
 control software for machinery to custom-made CRM applications.
 In recent years, more and more of his professional work has
 shifted to the .NET platform (C# and C++/CLI).


In his spare time Andreas still enjoys to program in
 standard C++, which is how [Boost.Statechart](/doc/libs/release/libs/statechart/doc/index.html)
 came into being. His other hobbies include swimming, camping,
 hiking and traveling.


Andreas lives in Zurich, Switzerland with his wife Ruth and
 son Marius.
