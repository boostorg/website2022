### New Libraries


* [Foreach Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/doc/html/foreach.html): `BOOST\_FOREACH` macro for easily iterating
 over the elements of a sequence, from Eric Niebler.
* [Statechart
 Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/statechart/doc/index.html):
 Arbitrarily complex finite state machines can be implemented
 in easily readable and maintainable C++ code, from Andreas Huber.
* [TR1 Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/tr1/index.html): An
 implementation of the C++ Technical Report on Standard Library Extensions,
 from John Maddock. This library does not itself implement the TR1 components,
 rather it's a thin wrapper that will include your standard library's TR1
 implementation (if it has one), otherwise it will include the Boost Library
 equivalents, and import them into namespace `std::tr1`.
 Highlights include: Reference Wrappers, Smart Pointers, result\_of, Function
 Object Binders, Polymorphic function wrappers, Type Traits, Random Number
 Generators and Distributions, Tuples, Fixed Size Array, Hash Function Objects,
 Regular Expressions, and Complex Number Additional Algorithms.
* [Typeof Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/doc/html/typeof.html): Typeof
 operator emulation, from Arkadiy Vertleyb and Peder Holt.
* [Xpressive
 Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/doc/html/xpressive.html): Regular expressions that can be written as strings or as
 expression templates, and that can refer to each other and themselves recursively
 with the power of context-free grammars, from Eric Niebler.

### Updated Libraries


* [Assign Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/assign/index.html):

	+ Support for `ptr\_map<key,T>` via the new function `ptr\_map\_insert()`
	+ Support for initialization of [Pointer
	 Containers](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/ptr_container/index.html) when the containers hold pointers to an abstract
	 base class.
* [Date\_time
 library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/doc/html/date_time.html):

	+ Support for new US/Canada timezone rules and other bug fixes. See
	 [Change
	 History](/doc/libs/1_34_0/doc/html/date_time/details.html#changes) for details.
* [Filesystem
 Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/filesystem/doc/index.htm): Major upgrade in preparation for submission to the C++
 Standards Committee for TR2. Changes include:
 
	+ [Internationalization](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/filesystem/doc/i18n.html#Internationalization),
	 provided by class templates *basic\_path*, *basic\_filesystem\_error*,
	 *basic\_directory\_iterator*, and *basic\_directory\_entry*.
	+ [Simplification](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/filesystem/doc/i18n.html#Simplification)
	 of the path interface by eliminating special constructors to identify
	 native formats.
	+ [Rationalization](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/filesystem/doc/i18n.html#Rationalization)
	 of predicate function design, including the addition of several new
	 functions.
	+ Clearer specification by reference to [POSIX](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/filesystem/doc/design.htm#POSIX-01),
	 the ISO/IEEE Single Unix Standard, with provisions for Windows and
	 other operating systems.
	+ [Preservation](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/filesystem/doc/i18n.html#Preservation)
	 of existing user code whenever possible.
	+ [More
	 efficient](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/filesystem/doc/i18n.html#More_efficient) directory iteration.
	+ Addition of a [recursive
	 directory iterator](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/filesystem/doc/tr2_proposal.html#Class-template-basic_recursive_directory_iterator).
* [Function
 Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/function/index.html):
 Boost.Function now implements a small buffer optimization,
 which can drastically improve the performance when copying or constructing
 Boost.Function objects storing small function objects. For instance, `bind(&X:foo, &x, \_1, \_2)` requires no heap allocation when placed
 into a Boost.Function object.
* [Functional/Hash
 Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/functional/hash/index.html):

	+ Use declarations for standard classes, so that the library doesn't
	 need to include all of their headers
	+ Deprecated the <boost/functional/hash/\*.hpp>
	 headers.
	+ Add support for the `BOOST\_HASH\_NO\_EXTENSIONS`
	 macro, which disables the extensions to TR1
	+ Minor improvements to the hash functions for floating point numbers.
* [Graph Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html):

	+ [`edmonds\_maximum\_cardinality\_matching`](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/graph/doc/maximum_matching.html),
	 from Aaron Windsor.
	+ [`lengauer\_tarjan\_dominator\_tree`](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/graph/doc/lengauer_tarjan_dominator.htm),
	 from JongSoo Park.
	+ [`compressed\_sparse\_row\_graph`](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/graph/doc/compressed_sparse_row.html),
	 from Jeremiah Willcock and Douglas Gregor of Indiana University.
	+ [`sorted\_erdos\_renyi\_iterator`](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/graph/doc/sorted_erdos_renyi_gen.html),
	 from Jeremiah Willcock of Indiana University.
	+ [`biconnected\_components`](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/graph/doc/biconnected_components.html)
	 now supports a visitor and named parameters, from Janusz Piwowarski.
	+ [`adjacency\_matrix`](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/graph/doc/adjacency_matrix.html) now models
	 the [Bidirectional
	 Graph](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/graph/doc/BidirectionalGraph.html) concept.
	+ [`dijkstra\_shortest\_paths`](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/graph/doc/dijkstra_shortest_paths.html)
	 now calls `vis.initialize\_vertex` for each vertex
	 during initialization.
	+ *Note:* the name of the compiled library for the
	 [GraphViz
	 reader](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/graph/doc/read_graphviz.html) has changed to boost\_graph (from
	 bgl-viz) to match Boost conventions.
	+ See the [complete
	 revision history](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/graph/doc/history.html#1.34.0) for more information.
* [MultiArray
 Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/multi_array/index.html):
 Boost.MultiArray now by default provides range-checking
 for `operator[]`.
 Range checking can be disabled by defining the macro `BOOST\_DISABLE\_ASSERTS`
 before including multi\_array.hpp. A bug in `multi\_array::resize()`
 related to storage orders was fixed.
* [Multi-index
 Containers Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/multi_index/doc/index.html):

	+ New [random
	 access indices](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/multi_index/doc/tutorial/indices.html#rnd_indices).
	+ Non key-based indices feature new [rearrange
	 facilities](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/multi_index/doc/tutorial/indices.html#rearrange).
	+ This version also includes a number of optimizations and usage improvements.
	 For a complete list of changes, see the library [release
	 notes](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/multi_index/doc/release_notes.html#boost_1_34).
* [Optional
 Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/optional/index.html):

	+ `boost::none\_t and
	boost::none` now added to Optional's documentation
	+ Relational operators now directly support arguments of type `'T'` and `'none\_t'`
	+ operator->() now also works with reference types.
	+ Helper functions `make\_optional(val), make\_optional(cond,val) and get\_optional\_value\_or(opt,alternative\_value)`
	 added.
	+ Constructor taking a boolean condition (as well as a value) added.
	+ Member function `get\_value\_or(alternative\_value)` added.
	+ Incompatbility bug with mpl::apply<> fixed.
	+ Converting assignment bug with uninitialized lvalues fixed.
* [Parameter
 Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/parameter/index.html):

	+ Every ArgumentPack is now a valid [MPL
	 Forward Sequence.](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/mpl/doc/refmanual/forward-sequence.html)
	+ Support for unnamed arguments (those whose keyword is deduced from
	 their types) is added.
	+ Support for named and unnamed template arguments is added.
	+ New overload generation macros solve the [forwarding
	 problem](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2002/n1385.htm) directly.
	+ See also the Python library changes, below.
* [Pointer
 Container Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/ptr_container/index.html):

	+ Support for serialization via [Boost.Serialization.](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/serialization/index.html)
	+ Exceptions can be disabled by defining the macro BOOST\_PTR\_CONTAINER\_NO\_EXCEPTIONS
	 before including any header. This macro is defined by default if
	 BOOST\_NO\_EXCEPTIONS is defined.
	+ Additional `std::auto\_ptr<T>`
	 overloads added s.t. one can also pass `std::auto\_ptr<T>` instead of only `T\*`
	 arguments to member functions.
	+ `transfer()`
	 now has weaker requirements s.t. one can transfer objects from `ptr\_container<Derived>`
	 to `ptr\_container<Base>`,
* [Python Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/python/index.html):

	+ Boost.Python now automatically appends C++ signatures to docstrings.
	 The new [docstring\_options.hpp](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/python/doc/v2/docstring_options.html)
	 header is available to control the content of docstrings.
	+ [`stl\_input\_iterator`](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/python/doc/v2/stl_iterator.html#stl_input_iterator-spec), for
	 turning a Python iterable object into an STL input iterator, from
	 Eric Niebler.
	+ Support for `void\*`
	 conversions is added.
	+ Integrated support for wrapping C++ functions built with the parameter
	 library; keyword names are automatically known to docsstrings.
	+ Enhancements to the API for better embedding support (`boost::python::import()`,
	 `boost::python::exec()`,
	 and `boost::python::exec\_file()`).
* [Signals Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/doc/html/signals.html): More
 improvements to signal invocation performance from Robert Zeh.
* [Smart
 Pointers Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/smart_ptr/smart_ptr.htm):

	+ [Allocator
	 support](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.htm#allocator_constructor) as proposed in [N1851](http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2005/n1851.pdf)
	 (162 Kb PDF).
	+ [`pointer\_cast`](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/smart_ptr/pointer_cast.html) and [`pointer\_to\_other`](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/smart_ptr/pointer_to_other.html) utilities
	 to allow pointer-independent code, from Ion Gaztanaga.
* [String
 Algorithm Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/algorithm/string/index.html):

	+ `lexicographical\_compare`
	+ `join`
	+ New comparison predicates `is\_less`,
	 `is\_not\_greater`.
	+ Negative indexes support (like Perl) in various algorihtms (`\*\_head/tail`,
	 `\*\_nth`).
* [Wave Library](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/wave/index.html):

	+ Wave now correctly recognizes pp-number tokens as mandated by the
	 C++ Standard, which are converted to C++ tokens right before they
	 are returned from the library.
	+ Several new preprocessing hooks have been added. For a complete description
	 please refer to the related documentation page: [The
	 Context Policy](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/wave/doc/class_reference_ctxpolicy.html).
	+ Shared library (dll) support has been added for the generated Wave
	 libraries.
	+ The overall error handling has been improved. It is now possible
	 to recover and continue after an error or a warning was issued.
	+ Support for optional comment and/or full whitespace preservation
	 in the generated output stream has been added.
	+ The Wave library now performs automatic include guard detection to
	 avoid accessing header files more than once, if appropriate.
	+ Full interactive mode has been added to the Wave tool. Now the Wave
	 tool can be used just like Python or Perl for instance to interactively
	 try out your BOOST\_PP macros. Additionally it is now possible to
	 load and save the current state of an interactive session (macro
	 tables et.al.).
	+ The overall performance has been improved by upto 40-60%, depending
	 on the concrete files to process.
	+ Support for new pragmas has been added allowing to control certain
	 library features from inside the preprocessed sources (partial output
	 redirection, control of generated whitespace and #line directives).
	+ Optional support for #pragma message "..." has been added.
	+ This version also includes a number of bug fixes and usage improvements.
	 For a complete list of changes, see the libraries [change
	 log](/doc/libs/1_34_0/libs/wave/ChangeLog).

### Supported Compilers
 Boost is tested on a wide range of compilers and platforms. Since Boost libraries
 rely on modern C++ features not available in all compilers, not all Boost libraries
 will work with every compiler. The following compilers and platforms have been
 extensively tested with Boost, although many other compilers and platforms
 will work as well. For more information, see the [regression
 test results](https://www.boost.org/regression/release/user/).
 


* [Apple GCC](http://developer.apple.com/) 4.0.1 on Mac
 OS X.
* [Borland C++](http://www.codegear.com/products/cppbuilder)
 5.8.2 on Windows.
* [GNU C++](http://gcc.gnu.org/)

	+ 3.2.x., 3.3.x, 3.4.x, 4.0.x, 4.1.x on Linux
	+ 4.1.x on Solaris
	+ 3.4.x on Windows
* [HP aC++ A.06.14](http://h30097.www3.hp.com/cplus/).
* [Intel
 C++](http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/compilers/index.htm) 9.1 on Windows, 9.0 on Linux.
* [Metrowerks CodeWarrior](http://www.metrowerks.com/)
 9.4 on Windows.
* [Microsoft Visual C++](http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/)
 6.0 (sp5, with and without STLport), 7.0, 7.1, 8.0. Note: Boost does not
 support the non-standard "Safe" C++ Library shipping with Visual
 C++ 8.0, which may result in many spurious warnings from Boost headers
 and other standards-conforming C++ code. To suppress these warnings, define
 the macro `\_SCL\_SECURE\_NO\_DEPRECATE`.
* [Sun
 Studio 11](http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/compilers_index.html) on Solaris.
