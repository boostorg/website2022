### Known Issues
 These are patches from library authors which were found too late to be fixed
 in the release. Be careful as they have not been through the normal testing
 process.
 


* Revert cease dependence on range
 
	+ [Coroutine
	 patch](/patches/1_72_0/0001-revert-cease-dependence-on-range.patch)

### Updated Libraries


* [Asio](/libs/asio/):

	+ Changed the `async\_initiate`
	 helper function to automatically deduce its return type, for C++11
	 or later.
	+ Changed all asynchronous operations to use automatically deduced
	 return types, for C++14 or later.
	+ Introduced concepts to support `async\_initiate`.
	+ Added the nested template type `rebind\_executor`
	 to all I/O object types.
	+ Changed the initiation function objects to report their associated
	 I/O executor via the nested type `executor\_type`
	 and member function `get\_executor()`.
	+ Added the `default\_completion\_token`
	 trait, giving I/O executor types an associated default completion
	 token type for use with asynchronous operations. This trait is specialised
	 for the `use\_awaitable`
	 completion token, for example, to allow asynchronous operations to
	 be used as follows: `co\_await
	socket.async\_connect(my\_endpoint)`.
	+ Added missing `async\_initiate`
	 to the Windows-specific I/O objects' asynchronous operations.
	+ Ensured that the executor type is propagated to newly accepted sockets.
	+ Changed to require that `Protocol`
	 copy and move operations never throw.
	+ Changed to require that `Endpoint`
	 default constructor and move operations never throw.
	+ Added the `noexcept` qualifier
	 to protocol accessors.
	+ Added the `noexcept` qualifier
	 to socket move constructors.
	+ Fixed issues associated with opening serial ports on Windows:
	 
		- Use the correct constant to initialise the RTS control flag.
		- Specify a default baud rate (9600).
	+ Fixed a lost "outstanding work count" that can occur when
	 an asynchronous accept operation is automatically restarted.
	+ Consult the [Revision
	 History](/doc/libs/1_72_0/doc/html/boost_asio/history.html) for further details.
* [Atomic](/libs/atomic/):

	+ Added a workaround for `\_\_float128`
	 not being considered as a floating point type by some versions of
	 libstdc++.
	+ Improved compatibility with clang-win compiler.
* [Beast](/libs/beast/):

	+ This is a maintenance update containing bug fixes, and updates to
	 use the new features delivered in Boost.Asio.
	+ We'd love to know how you or your company use Beast, consider adding
	 an entry to the [Companies
	 and Individuals Using Beast](https://github.com/boostorg/beast/wiki/Companies-and-Individuals-Using-Beast) list.
	+ See the full [Release
	 Notes](/libs/beast/doc/html/beast/release_notes.html) for a complete list of changes.
* [Circular Buffer](/libs/circular_buffer/):

	+ Fix issue [#29](https://github.com/boostorg/circular_buffer/issues/29): `max\_size()` now takes the allocator's `max\_size()`
	 into account. (Glen Fernandes)
* [Context](/libs/context/):

	+ architecture s390x supported
	+ execution\_context removed
* [Endian](/libs/endian/):

	+ Made `endian\_reverse`,
	 `conditional\_reverse`
	 and `\*\_to\_\*` `constexpr`
	 on GCC and Clang
	+ Added convenience load and store functions
	+ Added floating point convenience typedefs
	+ Added a non-const overload of `data()`; changed its return type to `unsigned char\*`
	+ Added `\_\_int128` support
	 to `endian\_reverse`
	 when available
	+ Added a convenience header `boost/endian.hpp`
* [Filesystem](/libs/filesystem/):

	+ Extracted `filesystem\_error`
	 to `exception.hpp`; `file\_status`
	 and associated enums and functions to `file\_status.hpp`;
	 `directory\_entry`,
	 `directory\_iterator`
	 and `recursive\_directory\_iterator`
	 to `directory.hpp`.
	+ **Deprecated:** For backward compatibility
	 `operations.hpp` still includes the new headers
	 `exception.hpp`, `file\_status.hpp`
	 and `directory.hpp`, unless `BOOST\_FILESYSTEM\_NO\_DEPRECATED`
	 macro is defined. These implicit includes are considered deprecated
	 and will be removed in a future release. Users are encouraged to
	 include the new headers directly or include `filesystem.hpp`.
	+ The `filesystem\_error`
	 exception is now implemented in the compiled library of Boost.Filesystem.
	 Users may need to add linking with Boost.Filesystem library in their
	 projects.
	+ On POSIX.1-2008 platforms, use `utimensat`
	 instead of `utime`.
	 `utime` is declared
	 obsolete in POSIX.1-2008 and can be disabled e.g. in uClibc-ng. ([PR#115](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/pull/115))
	+ `directory\_iterator`
	 is now left in the end state on memory allocation errors.
	+ In `directory\_iterator`
	 on POSIX systems, support for `readdir`/`readdir\_r` has been reworked to
	 avoid memory allocations for `dirent`
	 structures when `readdir`
	 is used. This reduces memory consumption and eliminates the possibility
	 of buffer overruns in case if `readdir`
	 produces a very long directory name.
	+ On Windows, use Boost.WinAPI to select the target Windows version.
	+ **New:** Added `directory\_options`
	 enum, which reflects the same named enum from C++20. The enum is
	 supported in `directory\_iterator`
	 and `recursive\_directory\_iterator`
	 to customize iteration behavior. In particular, the iterators now
	 support skipping directories that can't be opened due to insufficient
	 permissions. The `symlink\_option`
	 enum is now deprecated and should be replaced with `directory\_options`.
	+ By default, `recursive\_directory\_iterator`
	 is now reset to the end state in case of errors, as required by C++20.
	 ([#112](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/112))
	+ **New:** Added `directory\_options::pop\_on\_error`
	 option, which configures `recursive\_directory\_iterator`
	 so that it attempts to recover from iteration errors by repeatedly
	 invoking `pop()`
	 until it succeeds or the end state is reached. ([#113](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/113))
	+ **New:** Added `directory\_options::skip\_dangling\_symlinks`
	 option, which configures `recursive\_directory\_iterator`
	 so that it doesn't follow dangling directory symlinks and continues
	 iteration instead of reporting an error.
	+ **Deprecated:** The following members
	 of `recursive\_directory\_iterator`
	 are now marked as deprecated: `level()`, `no\_push\_pending()`, `no\_push\_request()`, `no\_push()`. Users are advised to replace their
	 use with the standard counterparts: `depth()`, `recursion\_pending()`, `disable\_recursion\_pending()`. Note that `recursion\_pending()` has the opposite meaning compared
	 to `no\_push\_pending()` and `no\_push\_request()`. Deprecated methods will be removed
	 in a future release.
	+ Fixed `path::lexically\_relative` (and any dependent
	 algorithms) to correctly handle empty, dot and dot-dot path elements
	 in its argument. The behavior is made closer to C++17 `std::path::lexically\_relative` in that empty
	 and dot path elements are ignored and dot-dot path elements are accounted
	 by decreasing the number of dot-dot path elements to generate in
	 the resulting relative path. ([#76](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/76))
* [Functional/Factory](/libs/functional/factory/):

	+ Glen Fernandes rewrote the implementations of `factory`
	 and `value\_factory`
	 to provide the following features:
	 
		- Support r-value arguments when possible
		- Support arbitrary number of arguments via variadic templates
		 when possible
		- Support allocators that are final
		- Support allocators that use fancy pointers
		- Support for disabled exceptions (`BOOST\_NO\_EXCEPTIONS`)
		- Improved compilation times
	+ The following features have been removed:
	 
		- Increasing limits for C++03 compilers through `BOOST\_FUNCTIONAL\_VALUE\_FACTORY\_MAX\_ARITY`
		- Using `boost::none\_t`
		 in place of `void`
		 through `BOOST\_FUNCTIONAL\_FACTORY\_SUPPORT\_NONE\_T`

* [Histogram](/libs/histogram/):

	+ Several new features and performance improvements, some bug-fixes
	+ See the full [Release
	 Notes](/libs/histogram/doc/html/histogram/history.html) for a complete list of changes
* [Log](/libs/log/):

	+ Improved compatibility with clang-win compiler.
* [MPI](/libs/mpi/):

	+ Documentation clarifications.
	+ Fixed scatterv bug when using explicit input buffer offsets.
	+ Enable usage of MPI\_Probe and friend with Intel MPI >= 2019.4
	+ Symbol visibility on Windows
* [Math](/libs/math/):

	+ Added Hypergeometric functions 1F0, 0F1, 2F0, 1F1 and pFq.
	+ Added Jacobi polynomial (and derivatives) evaluation.
	+ Added Gegenbauer polynomial (and derivatives) evaluation.
	+ Added Cardinal B-Splines (and derivatives) as polynomial functions
	 in their own right.
	+ Added Cardinal Trigonometric Interpolation.
	+ Added new statistics sub-section.
	+ Added One Sample Student's T Test.
	+ Added Anderson Darling test for normality.
	+ Added Ljung Box test for auto-correlation.
	+ Added Runs test for random sequences.
	+ The headers `boost/math/tools/univariate\_statistics.hpp`
	 and `boost/math/tools/bivariate\_statistics.hpp`, have been deprecated in favor
	 of `boost/math/statistics/univariate\_statistics.hpp` and `boost/math/statistics/bivariate\_statistics.hpp`.
	+ Added The Empirical CDF distribution.
	+ Reworked the Sterling approximation used by multiprecision gamma
	 functions to be applicable to all the function that use the Lanczos
	 approximation at regular precision. Also extended Lanczos approximations
	 up to 100 decimal digit precision.
* [Multiprecision](/libs/multiprecision/):

	+ Big `constexpr` update
	 allows cpp\_int and float128 arithmetic to be fully `constexpr` with gcc and clang 9 or
	 later, or any compiler supporting `std::is\_constant\_evaluated()`.
	+ Fix bug in variable precision mpf\_float which causes it to go into
	 a tailspin trying to select the correct precision - see https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues/164.
* [Outcome](/libs/outcome/):

	+ Enhancements:
	 
		- Standalone outcome is now `make
		install`-able, and
		 cmake `find\_package()` can find it. Note that you
		 must separately install and `find\_package()` Outcome's dependency, quickcpplib,
		 else `find\_package()` of Outcome will fail.
		- The git submodule mechanism used by standalone Outcome of specifying
		 dependent libraries has been replaced with a cmake superbuild
		 of dependencies mechanism instead. Upon cmake configure, an
		 internal copy of quickcpplib will be git cloned, built and
		 installed into the build directory from where an internal
		 `find\_package()` uses it. This breaks the
		 use of the unconfigured Outcome repo as an implementation of
		 Outcome, one must now do one of: 1. Add Outcome as subdirectory
		 to cmake build. 2. Use cmake superbuild (i.e. `ExternalProject\_Add()`)
		 to build and install Outcome into a local installation. 3.
		 Use one of the single header editions.
		- For standalone Outcome, the current compiler is now checked
		 for whether it will compile code containing C++ Concepts, and
		 if it does, all cmake consumers of Outcome will enable C++
		 Concepts. Set the cmake variable `CXX\_CONCEPTS\_FLAGS`
		 to an empty string to prevent auto detection and enabling of
		 C++ Concepts support occurring.
		- `OUTCOME\_TRY`
		 operation now hints to the compiler that operation will be
		 successful. [P1886 **Error speed benchmarking**](https://wg21.link/P1886) showed
		 that there is considerable gain in very small functions by
		 hinting to the compiler whether the expression is expected
		 to be successful or not. `OUTCOME\_TRY`
		 previously did not hint to the compiler at all, but now it
		 does. A new suite of macros `OUTCOME\_TRY\_FAILURE\_LIKELY`
		 hint to the compiler that failure is expected. If you wish
		 to return to the previously unhinted behaviour, define `OUTCOME\_TRY\_LIKELY(expr)`
		 to `(!!expr)`.
		- [#199](https://github.com/ned14/outcome/issues/199)
		 Support for C++ Coroutines has been added. This comes in two
		 parts, firstly there is now an `OUTCOME\_CO\_TRY()` operation suitable for performing
		 the `TRY` operation
		 from within a C++ Coroutine. Secondly, in the header `outcome/coroutine\_support.hpp` there are implementations
		 of `eager<OutcomeType>`
		 and `lazy<OutcomeType>`
		 which let you more naturally and efficiently use `basic\_result` or `basic\_outcome` from within
		 C++ Coroutines -- specifically, if the result or outcome will
		 construct from an exception pointer, exceptions thrown in the
		 coroutine return an errored or excepted result with the thrown
		 exception instead of throwing the exception through the coroutine
		 machinery (which in current compilers, has a high likelihood
		 of blowing up the program). Both `eager<T>` and `lazy<T>` can accept any `T` as well. Both have been
		 tested and found working on VS2019 and clang 9.
		- [#210](https://github.com/ned14/outcome/issues/210)
		`make\_error\_code()` and `make\_exception\_ptr()` are now additionally considered
		 for compatible copy and move conversions for `basic\_result<>`.
		 This lets you construct a `basic\_result<T, E>` into a `basic\_result<T, error\_code>`, where `E`
		 is a custom type which has implemented the ADL discovered free
		 function `error\_code
		make\_error\_code(E)`,
		 but is otherwise unrelated to `error\_code`.
		 The same availability applies for `exception\_ptr`
		 with `make\_exception\_ptr()` being the ADL discovered
		 free function. `basic\_outcome<>` has less support for
		 this than `basic\_result<>` in order to keep constructor
		 count down, but it will accept via this mechanism conversions
		 from `basic\_result<>` and `failure\_type<>`.
	+ Bug fixes:
	 
		- [#184](https://github.com/ned14/outcome/issues/184)
		 The detection of `[[nodiscard]]`
		 support in the compiler was very mildly broken.
* [PolyCollection](/libs/poly_collection/):

	+ Maintenance work.
* [Preprocessor](/libs/preprocessor/):

	+ Topic added which discusses emptiness
	+ Support for the C++20 `\_\_VA\_OPT\_\_`
	 construct
	 
		- `BOOST\_PP\_VARIADIC\_HAS\_OPT`
		 whether `\_\_VA\_OPT\_\_`
		 is supported at the C++20 level
		- `BOOST\_PP\_CHECK\_EMPTY`
		 test for emptiness using `\_\_VA\_OPT\_\_`
		 at the C++20 level
		- `BOOST\_PP\_VA\_OPT`
		 more flexible alternative to `\_\_VA\_OPT\_\_`
		 at the C++20 level
* [Smart Pointers](/libs/smart_ptr/):

	+ Implemented `allocate\_unique`
	 for scalars and arrays. (Glen Fernandes)
* [Test](/libs/test/):

	+ Boost.test v3.12 see the [Changes
	 log](/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/change_log.html) for more details.
	+ New feature:
	 
		- Support for C++17 `std::string\_view`
		 has been added.
		- Better diagnostic on `boost::exception`
		 and no rtti mode (thanks to Mikhail Pilin / [pull\_request 234])
	+ Bug fixes and pull requests:
	 
		- GitHub Issues: [#206](https://github.com/boostorg/test/issues/206), [#217](https://github.com/boostorg/test/issues/217), [#223](https://github.com/boostorg/test/issues/223), [#229](https://github.com/boostorg/test/issues/229)
		- GitHub Pull Requests: [PR#227](https://github.com/boostorg/test/pull/227), [PR#231](https://github.com/boostorg/test/pull/231), [PR#232](https://github.com/boostorg/test/pull/232),
		 [PR#234](https://github.com/boostorg/test/pull/234)
* [VMD](/libs/vmd/):

	+ `BOOST\_VMD\_IS\_EMPTY`
	 updated to use `\_\_VA\_OPT\_\_`
	 at the C++20 level has 100% reliability
