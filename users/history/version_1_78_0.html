### Known Issues
 These are patches from library authors which were found too late to be fixed
 in the release.
 


* Boost.Build silently skips installation of library headers and binaries
 in some cases, see [#104](https://github.com/bfgroup/b2/issues/104).
 
	+ Fixed in [PR#113](https://github.com/bfgroup/b2/pull/113),
	 [patch](/patches/1_78_0/0001-b2-fix-install.patch).
* Boost.Atomic fails to build when targeting UWP, see [#54](https://github.com/boostorg/atomic/issues/54). [Patch](/patches/1_78_0/0002-atomic-fix-uwp-build.patch).

### New Libraries


* No new libraries.

### Updated Libraries


* [Asio](/libs/asio/):

	+ Added an io\_uring backend that may optionally be used for all I/O
	 objects, including sockets, timers, and posix descriptors.
	+ Added support for files, with new new classes for stream-oriented
	 and random-access files. This feature currently supports I/O completion
	 ports on Windows, and io\_uring on Linux.
	+ Added support for portable pipes on POSIX and Windows (when I/O completion
	 ports are available).
	+ Added support for registered buffers, which are optimised when using
	 the io\_uring backend.
	+ Added experimental support for channels, that may be used to send
	 and queue completions as messages.
	+ Implemented improvements to `experimental::coro`.
	+ Disabled `aligned\_alloc`
	 on clang when using an MSVC runtime.
	+ Changed to use a faster implementation for `ip::network\_v4::canonical()`.
	+ Added template specialisations for common uses to improve compile
	 time.
	+ Reduced the size of `io\_context`
	 executors to a single pointer.
	+ Increased the small object buffer size for `execution::any\_executor`
	 and `any\_io\_executor`.
	+ Fixed multi-signature handling when variadic templates are disabled.
	+ Fixed compatibility with new versions of gcc and
	 clang.
	+ Fixed compilation on Solaris.
	+ Fixed defence against Qt-defined macros when building with MSVC.
	+ Improved error messages emitted by `ssl`
	 facilities.
	+ Fixed `bind\_executor`
	 compatibility with completion tokens.
	+ Fixed build errors when `BOOST\_ASIO\_USE\_TS\_EXECUTOR\_AS\_DEFAULT`
	 is defined.
	+ Added missing move assignment operator to `awaitable<>`.
	+ Fixed an access violation when using coroutines with MSVC, due to
	 incorrect alignment of allocated memory.
	+ Fixed a cleanup issue in `experimental::parallel\_group`
	 that occured when the execution context was shut down with parallel
	 operations still pending.
	+ Added clarifications to the documentation on concurrency hints.
	+ Added documentation on error handling techniques for C++20 coroutines.
	+ Fixed various warnings.
	+ Consult the [Revision
	 History](/doc/libs/1_78_0/doc/html/boost_asio/history.html) for further details.
* [Assert](/libs/assert/):

	+ Added `source\_location::to\_string`.
* [Atomic](/libs/atomic/):

	+ Use process-local futex operations on Android for non-IPC waiting
	 and notifying operations.
	+ Added support for Linux targets that only define `SYS\_futex\_time64`
	 syscall, such as riscv32.
	+ Added a workaround for incorrect result of `std::alignment\_of`
	 on clang 8 for 64-bit types on 32-bit x86 targets.
	+ Added a ulock backend for waiting and notifying operations on Darwin
	 systems since Mac OS 10.12, iOS 10.0, tvOS 10.0 or watchOS 3.0.
	+ On Windows, corrected discrepancy between *atomic-type*::always\_has\_native\_wait\_notify
	 and the corresponding capability macros when targeting Windows 8
	 or later. The library will now directly use `WaitOnAddress`
	 and related APIs from public headers and therefore require user to
	 link with `synchronization.lib`
	 if the user requires Windows 8 or later by defining `BOOST\_USE\_WINAPI\_VERSION`, `\_WIN32\_WINNT` or similar macros.
	 The library is linked automatically on compilers that support auto-linking
	 (e.g. MSVC).
	+ Added support for types with padding bits, except unions, on compilers
	 that provide a way to clear the padding bits. This feature is supported
	 by gcc 11 and MSVC 14.2 (compiler version 19.27) and newer, as well
	 as other compilers supporting similar intrinsics. On compilers that
	 don't allow to clear the padding bits, types with padding are still
	 generally not supported with the exception of 80-bit `long double`
	 on x86 targets. A new `BOOST\_ATOMIC\_NO\_CLEAR\_PADDING`
	 capability macro is defined to indicate when clearing the padding
	 is not supported.
	+ Initializing constructors of `atomic\_ref`
	 and `ipc\_atomic\_ref`
	 no longer use atomic instructions to clear the padding bits in the
	 referenced object. This reduces the cost of the atomic reference
	 construction.
	+ Initializing constructors of `atomic`
	 and `ipc\_atomic` are
	 now `constexpr` for enums,
	 classes and floating point types. For classes and floating point
	 types, the constructors are `constexpr`
	 if the compiler supports `constexpr`
	`std::bit\_cast`, the type has no padding
	 bytes and no padding is required to implement native atomic operations.
	+ In accordance with C++20, default constructors of `atomic`
	 and `ipc\_atomic` now
	 perform value initialization of the contained object. For types without
	 a user-defined default constructor, this means the default-constructed
	 atomic will be zero-initialized.
	+ Added a workaround for compilation error on AIX caused by the assembler
	 tool not supporting numeric labels. ([PR#50](https://github.com/boostorg/atomic/pull/50))
	+ Added a workaround for compilation error with Visual Studio 2015
	 prior to Update 3. ([#52](https://github.com/boostorg/atomic/issues/52))
	+ See [changelog](/doc/html/atomic/changelog.html)
	 for more details.
* [Beast](/libs/beast/):

	+ This maintenance update brings minor bug fixes and updated CI reporting.
	+ Fixed security vulnerability CVE-2016-9840 in zlib implementation.
	+ Fixed WebSocket permessage\_deflate implementation. This should result
	 in an increase in compression performance when using Beast WebSockets.
	+ Removed the test stream and test framework's dependency on RTTI.
	 You can now use our handy test stream to check your embedded asynchronous
	 communications code!
	+ We'd love to know how you or your company use Beast, consider adding
	 an entry to the [Companies
	 and Individuals Using Beast](https://github.com/boostorg/beast/wiki/Companies-and-Individuals-Using-Beast) list.
	+ See the full [Release
	 Notes](/libs/beast/doc/html/beast/release_notes.html) for a complete list of changes.
* [Core](/libs/core/):

	+ Added a generic implementation to `<boost/core/cmath.hpp>`,
	 enabled when `BOOST\_CORE\_USE\_GENERIC\_CMATH`
	 is defined or when the platform does not provide the necessary facilities
	 in `<cmath>`.
	+ Added `boost::core::type\_name`, a utility function that
	 returns the name of a type as a string.
	+ Added `boost::span`, a C++11 implementation of
	 C++20's `std::span` (Glen Fernandes).
* [Describe](/libs/describe/):

	+ Added `has\_describe\_enumerators`,
	 `has\_describe\_bases`,
	 `has\_describe\_members`.
	+ Added `enum\_to\_string`,
	 `enum\_from\_string`.
	+ Added relational and stream insertion operators.
	+ Added `descriptor\_by\_name`,
	 `descriptor\_by\_pointer`.
* [DLL](/libs/dll/):

	+ Fixed missing #include, thanks to Denis Blank ([PR#54](https://github.com/boostorg/dll/pull/54))
	+ Dropped TravisCI in favor of GithubAction CI
* [Filesystem](/libs/filesystem/):

	+ **v4:** `path::filename`
	 and `path::iterator` no longer return an implicit
	 trailing dot (".") element if the path ends with a directory
	 separator. Instead, an empty path is returned, similar to C++17 std::filesystem.
	 This also affects other methods that are defined in terms of iterators
	 or filename, such as `path::stem`,
	 `path::compare` or `lexicographical\_compare`.
	 For example, `path("a/b/") == path("a/b/.")`
	 no longer holds true. ([#193](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/193))
	+ **v4:** `path::lexically\_normal`
	 no longer produce a trailing dot (".") element and omits
	 a directory separator after a trailing dot-dot ("..") element
	 in the normalized paths.
	+ **v4:** `path`
	 append operations now consider root name and root directory in the
	 appended path. If the appended path is absolute, or root name is
	 present and differs from the source path, the resulting path is equivalent
	 to the appended path. If root directory is present, the result is
	 the root directory and relative path rebased on top of the root name
	 of the source path. Otherwise, the behavior is similar to v3. ([#214](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/214))
	+ `path::lexically\_normal` now converts directory
	 separators to preferred separators in the root name of the normalized
	 paths.
	+ Optimized overloads of `path::assign`,
	 `path::append`, `path::concat`
	 and the corresponding operators to avoid unnecessary path copying
	 and reduce the amount of code redundancy.
	+ On POSIX systems, fixed `absolute(p, base)` returning a path with root name
	 `base.root\_name()`
	 if `p` starts with
	 a root directory. In such a case `p`
	 is already an absolute path and should be returned as is.
	+ `create\_directories`
	 no longer reports an error if the input path consists entirely of
	 dot (".") and dot-dot ("..") elements. The implementation
	 is no longer using recursion internally and therefore is better protected
	 from stack overflow on extremely long paths.
	+ On Windows, `remove`
	 now supports deleting read-only files. The operation will attempt
	 to reset the read-only attribute prior to removal. Note that this
	 introduces a possibility of the read-only attribute being left unset,
	 if the operation fails and the original value of the attribute fails
	 to be restored. This also affects `remove\_all`.
	 ([#216](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/216))
	+ `remove\_all` now returns
	 `static\_cast<
	uintmax\_t >(-1)`
	 in case of error, similar to C++17 std::filesystem.
	+ Fixed a linking error about unresolved references to Boost.ContainerHash
	 functions when user's code includes `boost/filesystem/path.hpp`
	 but not `boost/container\_hash/hash.hpp` and the compiler is set to
	 preserve unused inline functions. ([#215](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/215))
	+ Added a workaround for MSVC and compatible compilers eliminating
	 path globals cleanup in release builds. This could lead to a memory
	 leak if Boost.Filesystem shared library was repeatedly loaded and
	 unloaded in the process. ([#217](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/217))
* [Geometry](/libs/geometry/):

	+ Improvements
	 
		- [PR#894](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/pull/894) Optimization and refactoring of rtree queries.
		- [PR#913](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/pull/913) DynamicGeometry and GeometryCollection support
		 in various algorithms (undocumented for now).
		- [PR#922](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/pull/922) DynamicGeometry and GeometryCollection support
		 in distance (undocumented for now).
	+ Solved issues
	 
		- [#867](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/issues/867) Poor performance of rtree query iterator with
		 nearest predicate for big k.
		- [#870](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/issues/870) Compilation error in boost::geometry::self\_turns.
		- [#896](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/issues/896) Assertion failure in get\_turns with BOOST\_GEOMETRY\_NO\_ROBUSTNESS.
	+ Bugfixes
	 
		- [PR#906](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/pull/906) Invalid result of buffer on macos-11 with
		 clang-12.
		- [PR#921](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/pull/921) Compilation errors with c++20 (various compilers)
		 and gcc-5.
		- Various fixes in set operations and buffer.
* [JSON](/libs/json/):

	+ Standalone mode of the library is deprecated.
	+ Allow external libraries to forward declare `value\_to`
	 and `value\_from`.
	+ Fixed signed integer overflow in number parsing.
	+ Add support for `/Zc:implicitNoexcept-` on MSVC.
* [Lambda2](/libs/lambda2/):

	+ Added special cases in `operator<<` and `operator>>` when the first argument is
	 a stream, to allow `std::cout
	<< \_1`.
	+ Added `operator->\*`.
	+ Added `first`, `second`.
* [Log](/libs/log/):

	+ General changes:
	 
		- Updated detection of `std::codecvt`
		 specializations for `char16\_t`
		 and `char32\_t` for
		 compatibility with C++17 and later. ([PR#159](https://github.com/boostorg/log/pull/159))
		- Added support for C++17 `std::byte`
		 type to receive methods of the inter-process message queue.
		- On Windows, when building the library for Windows 8 or later,
		 the library will use `nt62`
		 tag in the version namespace to denote the target OS ABI. For
		 example, the version namespace could be named as `v2\_mt\_nt62`. This name will
		 be part of all symbols exported by the library. Use the `BOOST\_USE\_WINAPI\_VERSION`
		 macro consistenly when building Boost and your code to request
		 the minimum target Windows version.
		- Improved performance of SSSE3 and AVX2 implementations of the
		 `dump` stream
		 manipulator.
		- Added support for CMake build system. Only library build is
		 supported at this moment, Boost.Build is still used for running
		 tests.
	+ Bug fixes:
	 
		- Fixed a race condition on POSIX systems in `reliable\_message\_queue::open\_or\_create`
		 or the equivalent constructor. Multiple threads or processes
		 calling `open\_or\_create`
		 concurrently with sending or receiving messages from the same
		 queue could end up corrupting the queue contents and potentially
		 crashing the process. ([#162](https://github.com/boostorg/log/issues/162))
		- Added a workaround for `b2
		install` failing on
		 Windows because of missing `boost\_log\_setup`
		 library if `BOOST\_LOG\_WITHOUT\_SETTINGS\_PARSERS`
		 is defined. ([#164](https://github.com/boostorg/log/issues/164))
	+ See [changelog](/libs/log/doc/html/log/changelog.html)
	 for more details.
* [Math](/libs/math/):

	+ Add support for cubic roots.
	+ Add support for `constexpr`
	 versions of various standard library math routines.
	+ Add support for Bezier polynomials.
	+ Improve worst-case tanh-sinh integration performance.
	+ Disable inadvertant use of integral types in integration routines.
	+ Minor update for erf approximations when the result is with 2ulp
	 of 1.
	+ Allow Bernoulli code to be used on platforms with no atomic integers.
	+ Improve the mode of the non-central Chi Squared distribution.
	+ Improve certain edge cases for <cstdfloat> complex-valued elementary
	 functions, see [#507](https://github.com/boostorg/math/issues/507).
* [Multi-index Containers](/libs/multi_index/):

	+ Added `contains` to
	 key-based indices (issue [#35](https://github.com/boostorg/multi_index/issues/35)).
	+ Added `merge` operations
	 to key-based indices. The functionality goes beyond the standard
	 specification for (unordered) associative containers in a number
	 of ways, most notably:
	 
		- The source index can be of any type, including non key-based
		 indices.
		- Partial merge is provided: for instance, `x.merge(y,first,last)` merges only the elements of
		 `y` within [`first`,`last`).
	+ Previous versions of `splice`
	 for sequenced and random access indices were destructive, i.e. elements
	 were copy-inserted into the destination and then erased from the
	 source. Now, `splice`
	 is based on node transfer much as `merge`
	 in key-based indices, and has been similarly extended to accept source
	 indices of any type: in fact, `splice`
	 can be regarded as a frontend to the same functionality provided
	 by `merge` in key-based
	 indices. For reasons of backwards compatibility, the destructive
	 behavior of `splice`
	 has been retained in the case that the source and destination containers
	 have unequal allocators.
	+ The fact has been documented that index iterator types do only depend
	 on `node\_type` and
	 the position of the index in its `multi\_index\_container`,
	 (except for hashed indices, where uniqueness/non-uniqueness is also
	 a dependency). This has implications on the validity of iterators
	 to elements transferred by `merge`
	 or `splice`. This property
	 is a variant of what has been called [SCARY
	 iterators](https://wg21.link/n2980) in the C++ standard mailing lists. SCARYness is
	 currently (August 2021) not mandated for standard containers.
	+ Iterator SCARYness is now also preserved in [safe
	 mode](/libs/multi_index/doc/tutorial/debug.html#safe_mode).
* [Multiprecision](/libs/multiprecision/):

	+ Rework rational\_adaptor to remove dependency on Boost.Rational and
	 improve performance.
	+ Fix issue with type\_traits and clang, see [#383](https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues/383).
	+ Fixed buggy Lehmer's GCD routine, see [#370](https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues/370).
	+ Fix mpc\_complex constructors so that lossy conversions are explicit,
	 see [#363](https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues/363).
	+ Correct miscellaneous configuration issues (Intel intrinsic usage
	 and Apple clang).
	+ Correct some iostream operators for unsigned char types.
	+ Correct mpq\_rational conversions to integer types, see [#342](https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues/342).
* [Nowide](/libs/nowide/):

	+ Breaking Change: `do\_unshift`
	 for the UTF-32 specialization of `utf8\_codecvt`
	 now correctly returns `noconv`
	 instead of `ok`
	+ Remove unnecessary branch in `utf8\_codecvt`
	 for UTF-16 output
	+ Suppress deprecation warnings in MSVC when using `utf8\_codecvt`
	 with unicode char types
	+ Fix possible double-free when setting a custom buffer (`setbuf`) after `filebuf`
	 already allocated an internal buffer
* [PFR](/libs/pfr/):

	+ Added missing `#include
	<memory>` for inclusion of `std::addressof`
	+ Fixed -Wzero-length-array warning when dealing with empty aggregates
	+ Fixed compilation on msvc compilers <= 1920 (thanks to Alexey
	 Romanov aka @alexey-romanov)
	+ Added basic CMakeLists.txt support (thanks to @pdimov aka Peter Dimov)
	+ Multiple improvements for docs, including links to https://github.com/apolukhin/pfr\_non\_boost
	+ Added misc/strip\_boost\_namespace.sh script to remove `boost::`
	 and `BOOST\_` prefixes
* [Predef](/libs/predef/):

	+ Version 1.13.1
	+ Fix spelling of "epoch".
	+ Add missing parenthesis in sparc.h (from tkoecker).
	+ Update documentation to use Rouge code styling and Amber general
	 style.
* [Regex](/libs/regex/):

	+ **Breaking Change:** Change \B to be
	 the opposite of \b as per Perl behaviour.
	+ Change w32\_regex\_traits.hpp so that windows.h is no longer included.
	+ Fxed fuzzing related issues [#151](https://github.com/boostorg/regex/issues/151),
	 [#152](https://github.com/boostorg/regex/issues/152),
	 [#153](https://github.com/boostorg/regex/issues/153),
	 [#156](https://github.com/boostorg/regex/issues/156).
* [System](/libs/system/):

	+ Added support for source locations to `error\_code`.
	+ Added `error\_code::to\_string`,
	 `error\_condition::to\_string`, `error\_code::what`.
	+ `system\_error::what()`
	 now contains the source location, if present.
	+ Added `result<T, E = error\_code>`,
	 a class holding either a value or an error, defined in `<boost/system/result.hpp>`.
* [Utility](/libs/utility/):

	+ Library documentation converted to QuickBook (thanks to Alan de Freitas,
	 [PR#79](https://github.com/boostorg/utility/pull/79)).
* [Variant2](/libs/variant2/):

	+ Added `<boost/variant2.hpp>`.
	+ Added `unsafe\_get<I>`.
	+ Added `visit\_by\_index`.
	+ Added `operator<<`.
