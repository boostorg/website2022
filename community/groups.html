Boost Mailing Lists



Boost Mailing Lists (A.K.A. Discussion Groups)
==============================================

The mailing lists are the heart of the Boost community. You
 may read the lists via full-content email or email digests.
Before Posting
--------------


**Read the [Discussion Policy
 and Guide to Effective Posting](policy.html).** Doing so will
 help you to ensure that your post is read by the people who
 can help you and received in the spirit in which it was
 intended.


**Subscribe your posting address.** As an
 anti-spam measure, postings to most Boost mailing lists will
 only be accepted if the posting's "From:" header contains an
 email address that is subscribed to the list. If you try to
 post from an address that isn't subscribed, you will probably
 get a message that says:
> 
> You are not allowed to post to this mailing list,
>  and your message has been automatically rejected. If you
>  think that your messages are being rejected in error,
>  contact the mailing list owner at *list
>  administrator's email address*.
> 
> 
> 


If you need to post from multiple email addresses, you
 should subscribe to each one separately. You can configure your
 subscription settings for any address to disable mail
 delivery via each mailing list's web interface.

Boost Users mailing list
------------------------


This list is oriented toward casual users of the Boost
 libraries. It is a good place to start if you are having
 trouble getting started with Boost or its individual libraries.
 Feel free to post both "newbie" and more challenging questions,
 but please check first to see if there's an appropriate
 [Project-Specific](#projects) list; you'll often get
 better answers in a forum dedicated to your problem area. This
 list is relatively low volume (less than 500 per month).
 Subscribe or unsubscribe at the [Boost Users list home page](https://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost-users).


Boost developers mailing list
-----------------------------


This is the main Boost mailing list. It is high volume (over
 1000 messages per month), very technical, and oriented toward
 Boost library developers. It is also read by many other members
 interested in watching the Boost library development process.
 Virtually all Boost decisions, major or minor, technical or
 otherwise, are reached via public discussion on this mailing
 list. It is where the formal reviews of proposed libraries take
 place. Subscribe or unsubscribe at <https://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost>.


When we talk about the "members of Boost", we are talking
 about those signed up for this main mailing list.


### Archives for Boost
 developers list


Archives of Boost messages include the [MailMan Archive](https://lists.boost.org/Archives/boost/) on [our home
 page](/).


Boost Announce mailing
 list
----------------------------


This is an announce-only list for notification of upcoming
 software releases and formal reviews of proposed libraries. One
 to three messages per month.  Subscribe or unsubscribe at
 the [Boost Announce list home page](https://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost-announce).


Boost Interest Mailing
 List
----------------------------


This list is a moderated low-traffic announcement-only list
 of interest to the Boost community. On-topic messages will
 include announcements of books, magazine articles, papers,
 talks, seminars, products, tools, events, or conferences on
 advanced uses of C++, generic/generative/meta-programming, and,
 of course, the Boost libraries. Off-topic will be discussion of
 any kind. Job postings are accepted at the moderators'
 discretion. Subscribe or unsubscribe at the [Boost-Interest home page](https://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost-interest).


Project-Specific
 lists
-----------------------

Several mailing lists have been established for
 specific Boost projects:

 ### Boost.Build list


The mailing list for the [Boost
 Build System](../build/) is located [here](https://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost-build).


### Boost CMake list


Development of the experimental [CMake build
 system](http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/CMake) is being coordinated on the [Boost
 CMake mailing list](https://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost-cmake). Any questions about CMake should be
 asked here and not on the main Boost.Build list.


### Python C++-Sig (for
 Boost.Python)


The [Python C++-sig](http://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/c++-sig/) is not strictly Boost-specific,
 but nearly all the traffic concerns [Boost.Python](/doc/libs/release/libs/python). See also the
 [Language Binding](#langbinding) list below. You can
 join the [mailing list](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/cplusplus-sig "Python C++-sig mailing list"). There are
 also searchable archives at [ASPN](http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Browse/Threaded/cpp-sig).


### Language
 Binding


The [Language Binding](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/boost-langbinding) list is for discussion of
 a generalized framework for binding C++ to other languages and
 systems based on the technology of [Boost.Python](/doc/libs/release/libs/python) and [Luabind](http://luabind.sourceforge.net/).
 The plan is to provide a single front-end for describing
 bindings with runtime-pluggable back ends for binding to
 specific languages.


### Boost.MPI Development


A separate developer mailing list for [Boost.MPI](/doc/libs/release/libs/mpi/) specific topics is
 located [here](https://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost-mpi).


### Boost.Spirit lists


Spirit has two additional mailing lists. [Spirit-general](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spirit-general) for Spirit users and
 [Spirit-devel](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spirit-devel) for Spirit developers (open
 to anyone who wishes to hang out with Spirit coders).


### Boost.Documentation
 list


The mailing list for the [Boost Documentation
 System](/doc/libs/release/doc/html/boostbook.html) is located [here](https://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost-docs).


### uBLAS development
 (ublas-dev) list


A separate user and developer mailing list for [Boost
 uBLAS](/doc/libs/release/libs/numeric/ublas/doc/) specific topics is located [here](https://lists.boost.org/).


### Thread development
 (threads-devel) list


A separate developer mailing list for [Boost Thread](/doc/libs/release/libs/thread/doc/index.html)
 specific topics is located [here](https://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/threads-devel).


**Important:** This mailing list is for the
 discussion of the specification and implementation of
 Boost.Threads only â€” questions regarding
 usage should be directed to the [Boost
 Users](#users) list, or the main [Boost
 developers](#main) list.


### Testing list


The setup, procedures and tools necessary for running Boost
 regression tests are discussed on [this list](https://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost-testing). The list's main participants are
 regression runners - people who run Boost tests on a variety of
 compilers and platforms, and the maintainers of tools for
 collecting and processing test results.


**Important:** questions relevant to a wider audience,
 including questions about Boost.Test framework or test results
 for a particular library, should be posted to main development
 list.


### Translation
 Groups


Boost doesn't have the resources to translate the
 documentation itself, but there is at least one separate group
 translating the documentation. If you have formed another, tell
 us on the [documentation list](#boostdocs) and we'll
 add a link.


* [Chinese
 translators group](http://groups.google.com/group/boost_doc_translation) ([main
 webpage](http://code.google.com/p/boost-doc-zh/))


#boost IRC channel
------------------


In addition to the mailing lists presented above, a #boost
 IRC channel on [freenode](http://freenode.net) is
 frequented by Boost developers and users. As usual with IRC
 channels, one should not necessarily expect that his questions
 will be answered right away. The channel is not strictly
 moderated.
