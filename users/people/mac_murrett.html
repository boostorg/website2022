===========

![-](mac_murrett.jpg) Mac
 Murrett is an Advanced Developer at [Vanteon](http://www.vanteon.com/). He
 lives in Rochester, NY, where everything closes at 10 PM. This
 gives him plenty of time to think.


Mac graduated from SUNY: University at Buffalo with a degree
 in Mathematics. He has been programming Macintoshes since he
 was 12 years old, and recently won [the Best Hack Contest](http://www.hax.com/MacHack/HackContest.html) at [MacHack 2001](http://www.machack.com/).
 Nonetheless, he swears up and down that his name has nothing to
 do with the computer.
