Boost Tools



Boost Tools
===========

Boost developers, testers, and maintainers have developed
 various programs to help with the administration of the Boost
 Libraries. Like everything else about Boost, these tools are
 available in source form, and are part of the regular Boost
 distribution.


Users may find these tools useful when porting Boost
 libraries to a new platform, or for use with their own
 applications.
[Boost.Build](/build/)
The Boost build system, including the full Boost version
 of the jam sources.
[Regression](tools/regression/index.html)
The Boost regression testing system reporting
 sources.
[Inspect](tools/inspect/index.html)
The inspection tool used to detect errors in the Boost
 directory hierarchy.
[BoostBook](../doc/html/boostbook.html)
A Boost documentation system, based on [DocBook](http://www.docbook.org/) and the [Extensible Stylesheet Language
 (XSL)](http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/), used by some Boost libraries.
[bcp](tools/bcp/)
A utility to extract subsets of Boost; to determine which
 parts of Boost your code is using; and to print reports on
 Boost usage (including Licence information).
[QuickBook](tools/quickbook/index.html)
QuickBook is a WikiWiki style documentation tool geared
 towards C++ documentation using simple rules and markup for
 simple formatting tasks. QuickBook generates [BoostBook](../doc/html/boostbook.html) XML.
[Wave](../libs/wave/doc/wave_driver.html)
A Standards conformant C/C++ preprocessor usable on top
 of any other compiler. Usable for instance for the debugging
 of the expansion of macros in your code or as a replacement
 for your built-in preprocessor.
