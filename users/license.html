Introduction
------------


The [Boost Software License](../LICENSE_1_0.txt)
 specifies the terms and conditions of use for all Boost
 libraries and tools.


History
-------


As Boost grew, it became unmanageable for each Boost file to
 have its own license. Users complained that each license needed
 to be reviewed, and that reviews were difficult or impossible
 if Boost libraries contained many different licenses. Boost
 moderators and maintainers spent excessive time dealing with
 license issues. Boost developers often copied existing licenses
 without actually knowing if the license wording met legal
 needs.


To clarify these licensing issues, the Boost moderators
 asked for help from the [Berkman Center for Internet & Society](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu)
 at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. It was requested that a
 single Boost license be developed that met the traditional
 requirements that Boost licenses, particularly:


* Must be simple to read and understand.
* Must grant permission without fee to copy, use and modify
 the software for any use.
* Must require that the license appear with all copies
 [including redistributions] of the software source code.
* Must not require that the license appear with executables
 or other binary uses of the library.
* Must not require that the source code be available for
 execution or other binary uses of the library.


Additionally, other common open source licenses were studied
 to see what additional issues were being treated, and additions
 representing good legal practice were also requested. The
 result is the [Boost Software
 License](../LICENSE_1_0.txt):
```

Rationale
---------


The following rationale was provided by Devin Smith, the
 lawyer who wrote the Boost Software License. It has been edited
 slightly for brevity. Editorial additions are shown in square
 brackets.


### Benefit of Common Software License


If one of Boost's goals is to ease use and adoption of the
 various libraries made available by Boost, it does make sense
 to try to standardize the licenses under which the libraries
 are made available to users. (I make some recommendations about
 a possible short-form license below.)


[Standardizing the license will not] necessarily address the
 issue of satisfying corporate licensees. Each corporation will
 have its own concerns, based on their own experiences with
 software licensing and distribution and, if they're careful,
 will want to carefully review each license, even if they've
 been told that they're all standard. I would expect that,
 unless we're remarkably brilliant (or lucky) in drafting the
 standard Boost license, the standard license won't satisfy the
 legal departments of all corporations. I imagine that some
 will, for instance, absolutely insist that licensors provide a
 warranty of title and provide indemnification for third-party
 intellectual property infringement claims. Others may want
 functional warranties. (If I were advising the corporations, I
 would point out that they're not paying anything for the code
 and getting such warranties from individual programmers, who
 probably do not have deep pockets, is not that valuable anyway,
 but other lawyers may disagree.)


But this can be addressed, not by trying to craft the
 perfect standard license, but by informing the corporations
 that they can, if they don't like the standard license,
 approach the authors to negotiate a different, perhaps even
 paid, license.


One other benefit of adopting a standard license is to help
 ensure that the license accomplishes, from a legal perspective,
 what the authors intend. For instance, many of the [original]
 licenses for the libraries available on boost.org do not
 disclaim the warranty of title, meaning that the authors could,
 arguably, be sued by a user if the code infringes the rights of
 a third party and the user is sued by that third party. I think
 the authors probably want to disclaim this kind of
 liability.


### Short-Form License


Without in anyway detracting from the draft license that's
 been circulated [to Boost moderators], I'd like to propose an
 alternative "short-form" license that Boost could have the
 library authors adopt. David [Abrahams] has expressed a desire
 to keep things as simple as possible, and to try to move away
 from past practice as little as possible, and this is my
 attempt at a draft.


This license, which is very similar to the BSD license and
 the MIT license, should satisfy the Open Source Initiative's
 Open Source Definition: (i) the license permits free
 redistribution, (ii) the distributed code includes source code,
 (iii) the license permits the creation of derivative works,
 (iv) the license does not discriminate against persons or
 groups, (v) the license does not discriminate against fields of
 endeavor, (vi) the rights apply to all to whom the program is
 redistributed, (vii) the license is not specific to a product,
 and (viii) the license is technologically neutral (i.e., it
 does not [require] an explicit gesture of assent in order to
 establish a contract between licensor and licensee).


This license grants all rights under the owner's copyrights
 (as well as an implied patent license), disclaims all liability
 for use of the code (including intellectual property
 infringement liability), and requires that all subsequent
 copies of the code [except machine-executable object code],
 including partial copies and derivative works, include the
 license.


FAQ
---


How should Boost
 programmers apply the license to source and header
 files? Add a comment based on
 the following template, substituting appropriate text for the
 italicized portion:
```

//          
// Distributed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0.
//    (See accompanying file LICENSE\_1\_0.txt or copy at
//          https://www.boost.org/LICENSE\_1\_0.txt)

```

Please leave an empty line before and after the above
 comment block. It is fine if the copyright and license messages
 are not on different lines; in no case there should be other
 intervening text. Do not include "All rights reserved"
 anywhere.


Other ways of licensing source files have been considered,
 but some of them turned out to unintentionally nullify legal
 elements of the license. Having fixed language for referring to
 the license helps corporate legal departments evaluate the
 boost distribution. Creativity in license reference language is
 strongly discouraged, but judicious changes in the use of
 whitespace are fine.


How should the
 license be applied to documentation files, instead?
Very similarly to the way it is
 applied to source files: the user should see the very same text
 indicated in the template above, with the only difference that
 both the local and the web copy of LICENSE\_1\_0.txt should be
 linked to. Refer to the HTML source code of this page in case
 of doubt.


How should Boost
 programmers maintain the copyright messages?
Copyright is only claimed for changes
 meeting a certain threshold of originality. Therefore, the copyright
 message only covers expressions of creativity. It is up to authors of
 changes to add themselves to the copyright message if they so decide.
 Typically, new claimant is added when someone takes over maintenance
 of a library or new version of an existing library is developed.
 In principle, do not ever remove previous copyright claims -
 just add new claims and/or claimants.


How is the Boost
 license different from the [GNU General Public License (GPL)](https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php)?
The Boost license permits the creation
 of derivative works for any use with
 no legal requirement to release your source code. Other
 differences include Boost not requiring reproduction of
 copyright messages for object code redistribution, and the fact
 that the Boost license is not "viral": if you distribute your
 own code along with some Boost code, the Boost license applies
 only to the Boost code (and modified versions thereof); you are
 free to license your own code under any terms you like. The GPL
 is also much longer, and thus may be harder to understand.


Why the phrase
 "machine-executable object code generated by a source language
 processor"? To distinguish
 cases where we do not require reproduction of the copyrights
 and license, such as object libraries, shared libraries, and
 final program executables, from cases where reproduction is
 still required, such as distribution of self-extracting
 archives of source code or precompiled header files. More
 detailed wording was rejected as not being legally necessary,
 and reducing readability.


Why is the
 "disclaimer" paragraph of the license entirely in
 uppercase? Capitalization of
 these particular provisions is a US legal mandate for consumer
 protection. (Diane Cabell)


Does the copyright
 and license cover interfaces too? The conceptual interface to a library isn't
 covered. The particular representation expressed in the header
 is covered, as is the documentation, examples, test programs,
 and all the other material that goes with the library. A
 different implementation is free to use the same logical
 interface, however. Interface issues have been fought out in
 court several times; ask a lawyer for details.


Why doesn't the
 license prohibit the copyright holder from patenting the
 covered software? No one who
 distributes their code under the terms of this license could
 turn around and sue a user for patent infringement. (Devin
 Smith)


Boost's lawyers were well aware of patent provisions in
 licenses like the GPL and CPL, and would have included such
 provisions in the Boost license if they were believed to be
 legally useful.


Why doesn't the
 copyright message say "All rights reserved"?
Devin Smith says "I don't think it
 belongs in the copyright notice for anything (software,
 electronic documentation, etc.) that is being licensed. It
 belongs in books that are sold where, in fact, all rights
 (e.g., to reproduce the book, etc.) are being reserved in the
 publisher or author. I think it shouldn't be in the BSD
 license."


Do I have to
 copyright/license trivial files? Even a test file that just contains an empty
 `main()` should have a copyright. Files without
 copyrights make corporate lawyers nervous, and that's a barrier
 to adoption. The more of Boost is uniformly copyrighted and
 licensed, the less problem people will have with mounting a
 Boost release CD on a corporate server.


Can I use the Boost
 license for my own projects outside Boost? Sure; there are no restrictions on the use of the
 license itself.


[![Open Source (OSI) Logo](https://opensource.org/trademarks/opensource/web/opensource-110x95.png)](https://opensource.org/docs/definition.php)Is the Boost
 license "[Open Source](https://opensource.org/docs/osd)"? Yes. The [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) certified the
 [Boost Software License 1.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/bsl1.0.html) in early
 2008.


Transition
----------


To ease the transition of the code base towards the new
 common license, several people decided to give a [blanket
 permission](/doc/libs/release/more/blanket-permission.txt) for all their contributions to use the new
 license. This hopefully helps maintainers to switch to the new
 license once the list contains enough names without asking over
 and over again for each change. Please consider adding your
 name to the list.
