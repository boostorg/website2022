### New Libraries


* No new libraries

### Updated Libraries


* [Asio](/libs/asio/):

	+ Added `ip::scope\_id\_type` type alias.
	+ Added `ip::port\_type` type alias.
	+ Added `std::hash` specialisations for IP addresses.
	+ Added `std::hash` specialisations for `ip::basic\_endpoint<>`.
	+ Refactored SFINAE usage to improve compile times.
	+ Added friendship support to customisation points, and made most customisations
	 private.
	+ Changed `any\_io\_executor`
	 to a "strong typedef"-style class.
	+ Fixed `experimental::as\_single`
	 to work with handler hook deprecation.
	+ Ensured pthread condition variable attributes are cleaned up on all
	 platforms.
	+ Clarified thread safety notes on sockets and descriptors.
	+ Ensured `errno` is
	 not overwritten if `socket()` fails on macOS/FreeBSD.
	+ Fixed work tracking for `io\_context`
	 and `thread\_pool` executors
	 when move-assigned.
	+ Ensured internal `call\_stack`
	 objects are accessed only from implementation files.
	+ Fixed I/O object move-assignment to ensure the executor is left in
	 a valid state.
	+ Fixed detection of compiler support for defaulted template argument
	 on functions with MSVC.
	+ Prevented the `blocking.always`
	 property from being used with `strand<>`, as it did not produce the
	 correct semantics.
	+ Removed deprecated file asio/impl/src.cpp.
* [Atomic](/libs/atomic/):

	+ Fixed compilation with MSVC for ARM. ([PR#49](https://github.com/boostorg/atomic/pull/49))
* [Beast](/libs/beast/):

	+ This update brings minor bug fixes and revamped CI reporting.
	+ We'd love to know how you or your company use Beast, consider adding
	 an entry to the [Companies
	 and Individuals Using Beast](https://github.com/boostorg/beast/wiki/Companies-and-Individuals-Using-Beast) list.
	+ See the full [Release
	 Notes](/libs/beast/doc/html/beast/release_notes.html) for a complete list of changes.
* [Bind](/libs/bind/):

	+ Add support for using the standard C++11 placeholders with `boost::bind`.
	+ Update `boost::apply` to use variadic templates
	 and perfect forwarding.
* [Container](/libs/continer/):

	+ Added [[no-discard]] attribute in all containers to catch bugs related
	 to unused return values.
	+ Replaced default standard exception classes with Boost.Container
	 own classes, reducing considerably the included files overhead. Example:
	 in MSVC 19 `boost/container/vector.hpp`
	 preprocessed file size reduces from 1,5MB to 930KB. If you still
	 want to use standard exception classes, you can define `BOOST\_CONTAINER\_USE\_STD\_EXCEPTIONS`
	 before using any Boost.Container class.
	+ Fixed bugs/issues:
	 
		- [GitHub
		 #102: *"flat\_map::insert ambiguous with initializer
		 list & pairs that need to convert"*](https://github.com/boostorg/container/issues/102).
		- [GitHub
		 #139: *"flat\_map merge and iterators"*](https://github.com/boostorg/container/issues/139).
		- [GitHub

		 `std::tuple`"*](https://github.com/boostorg/container/issues/164).
		- [GitHub
		 #171: *"deque::clear() uses undefined behaviour"*](https://github.com/boostorg/container/issues/171).
* [Core](/libs/core/):

	+ Add implicit conversion between compatible reference wrappers.
	+ Add `boost/core/cmath.hpp`, a portable implementation
	 of the floating point classification functions from `<cmath>`.
	+ Add `boost/core/bit.hpp`, a portable implementation
	 of the C++20 standard header `<bit>`.
	+ Fix `BOOST\_TEST\_EQ`,
	 `BOOST\_TEST\_NE` for
	 character types under C++20.
	+ Revise allocator access utilities (now support VS2013, and no workarounds
	 use `allocator\_traits`.)
* [DLL](/libs/dll/):

	+ **BREAKING CHANGE**: `boost::dll::import`
	 was renamed to `boost::dll::import\_symbol`
	 to avoid collision with C++20 `import`
	 keyword.
	+ Updated docs, including FAQ section.
* [Filesystem](/libs/filesystem/):

	+ Updated compatibility with WASI platform. ([PR#169](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/pull/169))
	+ Fixed an exception being thrown by `path::remove\_filename`
	 if the path is "////". ([#176](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/176))
	+ Fixed `create\_directories`
	 disregarding errors from file status query operations issued internally.
	 This could result in incorrect error codes returned by `create\_directories`. ([#182](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/182))

	 We will also change the required minimum C++ version from C++11 to
	 C++14.
* [Histogram](/libs/histogram/):

	+ This release contains critical fixes, please check that your results
	 are not affected.
	+ See [Release
	 Notes](/libs/histogram/doc/html/histogram/history.html) for details.
* [Intrusive](/libs/intrusive/):

	+ Reduced compile-time dependencies:
	 
		- `linear\_slist\_algorithms`
		 use a simple node\_ptr instead of std::pair on return.
		- `list`/`slist` use `operator
		<`/`operator
		==` instead of `std::equal\_to`/`std::less`.
	+ Fixed [GitHub
	 #54: *set.rbegin() looks like O(log(N))*](https://github.com/boostorg/intrusive/issues/54)
* [Interprocess](/libs/interprocess/):

	+ Added `wchar\_t` API support
	 for named resources in operating systems that offer native wide character
	 API (e.g. Windows). The following classes were updated with `wchar\_t` name support:
	 
		- `file\_mapping`
		- `managed\_mapped\_file`
		- `managed\_shared\_memory`
		- `managed\_windows\_shared\_memory`
		- `shared\_memory\_object`
		- `windows\_shared\_memory\_object`

	 shared synchronization primitives instead of native POSIX or Winapi
	 functions.
	+ Fixed bugs:
	 
		- [GitHub
		 #76 (*"Cygwin compilation errors"*)](https://github.com/boostorg/interprocess/issues/76).
		- [GitHub
		 #83 (*"Add BOOST\_INTERPROCESS\_FORCE\_NATIVE\_EMULATION
		 option"*)](https://github.com/boostorg/interprocess/pull/83).
		- [GitHub
		 #92 (*"bufferstream: Correct MSVC compilation
		 warning"*)](https://github.com/boostorg/interprocess/pull/92).
		- [GitHub
		 #106 (*"Use fallocate on truncate\_file"*)](https://github.com/boostorg/interprocess/pull/106).
		- [GitHub
		 #120 (*"segment\_manager customization"*)](https://github.com/boostorg/interprocess/issues/120).
		- [GitHub
		 #122 (*"Mark constructors/assignment/swap noexcept
		 where possible"*)](https://github.com/boostorg/interprocess/issues/122).
		- [GitHub
		 #126 (*"\_ReadWriteBarrier is deprecated warning
		 when compiling with clang-cl.exe"*)](https://github.com/boostorg/interprocess/issues/126).
* [JSON](/libs/json/):

	+ [Security
	 Report](https://cppalliance.org/pdf/C%20Plus%20Plus%20Alliance%20-%20Boost%20JSON%20Security%20Assessment%202020%20-%20Assessment%20Report%20-%2020210317.pdf) from Bishop Fox.
	+ ([#481](https://github.com/boostorg/json/issues/481)) Refactored `value\_from`
	 implementation; user customizations are now always preferred over
	 library-provided overloads.
	+ ([#484](https://github.com/boostorg/json/issues/484)) Fix imprecise parsing for some floating point numbers.
	+ ([#485](https://github.com/boostorg/json/issues/485)) Fix link errors in standalone mode, when used alongside
	 Boost.
	+ ([#497](https://github.com/boostorg/json/issues/497)) Fix Boost.Build builds on GCC 4.8.
* [LexicalCast](/libs/lexical_cast/):

	+ Dropped dependency on Boost.Math (thanks to Peter Dimov [#37](https://github.com/boostorg/lexical_cast/issues/37),
	 [#39](https://github.com/boostorg/lexical_cast/issues/39)).
	+ Fixes for the CI and coverage (thanks to Sam Darwin from "The
	 C++ Alliance" [#38](https://github.com/boostorg/lexical_cast/issues/38), [#42](https://github.com/boostorg/lexical_cast/issues/42)).
* [Log](/libs/log/):

	+ Bug fixes:
	 
		- Corrected a formal race condition in the thread-safe log record
		 queue implementation used in the `unbounded\_fifo\_queue`
		 policy of the `asynchronous\_sink`
		 frontend. The race could be detected by TSAN, but it was not
		 a real problem on most current CPU architectures and compilers.
		 ([#139](https://github.com/boostorg/log/issues/139))
		- When copying a logger with a channel attribute (e.g. `channel\_logger`), the channel
		 attribute is now deep-copied from the original logger. This
		 means that modifying the channel in the new logger will no
		 longer affect the original logger.
		- Replaced the use of `std::allocator<void>` in template parameters
		 with a new tag type `boost::log::use\_std\_allocator`
		 to silence libc++ warnings about the former being deprecated
		 in C++17 and later. The tag indicates that the instantiated
		 template should be using a specialization of `std::allocator` internally to allocate
		 dynamic memory, so the change has no functional effect. ([#141](https://github.com/boostorg/log/issues/141))
		- Boost.Log no longer defines `\_\_MSVCRT\_VERSION\_\_`
		 macro on MinGW and MinGW-w64. Defining this macro caused incompatibility
		 with UCRT, which is available as an option in recent MinGW-w64.
		 ([PR#149](https://github.com/boostorg/log/pull/149))
	+ See [changelog](/libs/log/doc/html/log/changelog.html)
	 for more details.
* [Math](/libs/math/):

	+ **Breaking Change:** C++03 support is
	 now removed, a C++11 or later conformant compiler is now required
	 to use this library.
	+ Added Z-test.
	+ Added execution policy support to univariate and bivariate statistics:
	 enables parallel execution (requires C++17 and `<execution>`).
	+ Big update/improvement on CI testing.
	+ Bivariate statistics now have integer support.
	+ T-Test now has integer support.
	+ Linear regression now has integer support.
	+ Correct PDF of the beta distribution at the endpoints.
	+ Correct use of Stirling's approximation in certain multiprecision
	 cases, fixes [#396](https://github.com/boostorg/math/issues/396).
	+ Eliminate -Wimplicit-int-float-conversion on clang.
	+ Fix some constexpr issues in quaternion/octonion.
	+ Minor performance fix to tanh\_sinh integration.
	+ Update hypergeometric functions internal scaling to allow for 64-bit
	 (long long) exponents with multiprecision types.
* [Move](/libs/move/):

	+ [Git Issue
	 #35: *"New nothrow move traits are incomplete"*](https://github.com/boostorg/move/issues/35).
* [Multiprecision](/libs/multiprecision/):

	+ **BREAKING CHANGE**: Massive refactoring
	 and code simplification makes C++11 an absolute requirement.
	+ Use BOOST\_TRY/CATCH in headers so code can be used in exception-free
	 environments.
	+ Correct corner case in pow, fixes [#277](https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues/277).
	+ Correct exception type thrown to match docs in lsb/msb: fixes [#257](https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues/257).
	+ Allow moves and operators between related but different types (ie
	 types with the same allocator), fixes [#278](https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues/278).
* [Nowide](/libs/nowide/):

	+ Fix discarding of characters for text file streams when seek or sync
	 functions are used and newlines were converted (e.g. on Windows)
	+ Fix potential use-after-free bug when reusing (via `open`) a file stream that has been
	 closed
	+ Fix potential invalid memory access when using a file stream that
	 has been moved or swapped to where the source had a put-back character
	 or was set to unbuffered mode
	+ Fix compatibility with ucrt runtime by not defining `\_\_MSVCRT\_VERSION\_\_`
	+ Known issues: Read performance for text files is degraded. Binary
	 files and writing is unaffected.
* [Optional](/libs/optional/):

	+ Fixed MSVC warning C4702.
* [Outcome](/libs/outcome/):

	+ Announcements:
	 
		- BREAKING CHANGE: After a year and three major Boost releases
		 announcing this upcoming change, this is the FIRST RELEASE
		 of the v2.2 branch. This branch has a number of major breaking
		 changes to the Outcome v2.1 which shipped in Boost 1.75 and
		 earlier, see the documentation for details.
	+ Enhancements:
	 
		- VS2019.8 changed how to enable Coroutines, which caused Outcome
		 to not compile on that compiler.
		- If on C++ 20, we now use C++ 20 `[[likely]]`
		 instead of compiler-specific markup to indicate when TRY has
		 likely success or failure.
		- BREAKING CHANGE: Previously the value of `spare\_storage(const
		basic\_result|basic\_outcome \*)
		noexcept` was not propagated
		 over `BOOST\_OUTCOME\_TRY`,
		 which causes things like stack backtraces captured at the point
		 of construction of an errored result to get dropped at every
		 `TRY` point.
		 This has been fixed by adding an optional `spare\_storage`
		 to `success\_type<T>` and `failure\_type<T>`, as well as to `auto success(T
		&&, ...)`
		 and `auto failure(T
		&&, ...)`.
	+ Bug fixes:
	 
		- Boost.Outcome should now compile with `BOOST\_NO\_EXCEPTIONS`
		 defined. Thanks to Emil, maintainer of Boost.Exception, making
		 a change for me, Boost.Outcome should now compile with C++
		 exceptions globally disabled. You won't be able to use `boost::exception\_ptr` as it can't
		 be included if C++ exceptions are globally disabled.
		- BREAKING CHANGE [#244](https://github.com/ned14/outcome/issues/244)
		 It came as a shock to learn that `BOOST\_OUTCOME\_TRY`
		 had been broken since the inception of this library for certain
		 corner case code, which required a breaking change in how TRY
		 works. See [the
		 changelog in the documentation for more detail](https://boostorg.github.io/outcome/changelog.html).
* [Parameter](/libs/parameter/):

	+ Added a workaround for MSVC 2015 code miscompilation when an rvalue
	 was used as a default value of a named parameter of a function. ([PR#109](https://github.com/boostorg/parameter/pull/109),
	 [#132](https://github.com/boostorg/log/issues/132))
* [PFR](/libs/pfr/):

	+ Fixed reflection of types with missing `const`
	 in SFINAE expressions in template constructor. Now reflection of
	 aggregates with `std::optional<std::chrono::duration<???>>` fields works on any
	 Standard Library implementation, even if LWG3050 is not fixed.
	+ Comparison functions are now `constexpr`
	[#52](https://github.com/boostorg/pfr/issues/52)
	+ Fixed numerous typos in docs (thanks to Phil Miller [#63](https://github.com/boostorg/pfr/issues/63))
* [PolyCollection](/libs/poly_collection/):

	+ Worked around [GCC
	 bug](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=95888) affecting GCC versions 9.3-10.2 (issue [#20](https://github.com/boostorg/poly_collection/issues/20)).
* [Predef](/libs/predef/):

	+ Version 1.13
	+ Add `ARCH\_PPC\_64` predef.
	+ Fix `ARCH\_WORD\_BITS\*` redefinition warnings/errors.
	+ Add `ARCH\_E2K`, Elbrus
	 2000, architecture from Konstantin Ivlev.
	+ Fix not handling recent C++ version that go above 10.x version.
	+ Version 1.12
	+ Switch to using the endian.h header on OpenBSD. (Brad Smith)
	+ Fix not handling recent versions of stdcxx that go above version
	 9.
	+ Fix including sub-BSD OS headers directly causing redef warnings.
	+ Add CI testing of direct inclusion of all headers.
	+ Add CI testing on FreeBSD for clang and gcc.
	+ Add `WORD\_BITS` set
	 of predefs to detect the architecture word size. Initial implementation
	 inspired by submission from Mikhail Komarov.
	+ Add CI testing for Cygwin 32 and 64.
* [PropertyTree](/libs/property_tree/):

	+ Property Tree has a new maintainer.
	+ Fix usage of deprecated Boost.Bind features.
	+ Link to Wikipedia fixed.
	+ Use BOOST\_OVERRIDE to fix GCC warnings.
	+ Add extensive CI testing.
* [Regex](/libs/regex/):

	+ Regex is now header only except in C++03 mode.
	+ Support for C++03 is now deprecated.
	+ The library can now be used "standalone" without the rest
	 of Boost being present.
* [Stacktrace](/libs/stacktrace/):

	+ Better support for pre-C++11 builds on clang [#102](https://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/102).
	+ Bigger warning for **do not use boost::stacktrace::stacktrace
	 in signal handlers** [#71](https://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/71).
* [TypeTraits](/libs/type_traits/):

	+ Fix for Visual Studio managed code projects.
* [Variant2](/libs/variant2/):

	+ Improved generated code for the double buffered case.

### Updated Tools
