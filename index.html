Boost C++ Libraries





Welcome to Boost.org!
---------------------


Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source
 libraries.


We emphasize libraries that work well with the C++
 Standard Library. Boost libraries are intended to be widely
 useful, and usable across a broad spectrum of applications.
 The [Boost license](/users/license.html)
 encourages the use of Boost libraries for all users with
 minimal restrictions.


We aim to establish "existing practice" and provide
 reference implementations so that Boost libraries are
 suitable for eventual standardization. Beginning with the
 ten Boost Libraries included in the Library Technical
 Report ([TR1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2005/n1745.pdf)) and continuing with every release
 of the ISO standard for C++ since 2011, the [C++ Standards Committee](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/) has continued to
 rely on Boost as a valuable source for additions to the
 Standard C++ Library.


Boost as an organization
------------------------


The Boost organization and wider Boost community
 supports research and education into the best possible uses
 of C++ and libraries developed for it, particularly, but
 not exclusively those contained in the Boost Library.


The organization and community support mailing lists and
 chat rooms to educate about best practices and cutting edge
 techniques for the user of Boost Libraries and C++ in
 general.


Since 2006 an intimate week long annual conference
 related to Boost called [C++ Now](http://cppnow.org/) has been held in Aspen, Colorado
 each May. The conference is an educational opportunity
 focused on cutting-edge C++. Boost has been a participant
 in the annual Google Summer of Code since 2007, in which
 students develop their skills by working on Boost Library
 development.


### Getting Started


Boost works on
 almost any modern operating system, including UNIX and
 Windows variants. Follow the [Getting
 Started Guide](/doc/libs/release/more/getting_started/index.html) to download and install Boost. Popular
 Linux and Unix distributions such as [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/),
 [Debian](http://www.debian.org/), and [NetBSD](http://www.netbsd.org/) include pre-built Boost
 packages. Boost may also already be available on your
 organization's internal web server.


If you want to
 develop Boost, there's a [getting
 started guide](https://github.com/boostorg/wiki/wiki/Getting-Started) on the wiki.


### Background


Read on with the
 [introductory material](/users/) to help you
 understand what Boost is about and to help in educating
 your organization about Boost.


### Community


Boost welcomes and
 thrives on participation from a variety of individuals and
 organizations. Many avenues for participation are available
 in the [Boost
 Community](/community/).
