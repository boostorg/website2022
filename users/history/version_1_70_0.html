### Known Issues
 These are patches from library authors which were found too late to be fixed
 in the release. Be careful as they have not been through the normal testing
 process.
 


* Fix moved-from executor in idle ping timeout ([#1599](https://github.com/boostorg/beast/issues/1599))
 
	+ [Beast
	 patch](/patches/1_70_0/0001-beast-fix-moved-from-executor.patch)

### New Libraries


* [Outcome](/libs/outcome/): A set of tools for reporting
 and handling function failures in contexts where *directly*
 using C++ exception handling is unsuitable, from Niall Douglas.
* [Histogram](/libs/histogram/): Fast and extensible
 multi-dimensional histograms with convenient interface for C++14, from
 Hans Dembinski.

### Updated Libraries


* [Asio](/libs/asio/):

	+ This release includes a number of new features, bug fixes, performance
	 enhancements, and documentation improvements. Notable changes include:
	 
		- Added the ability to use custom I/O executors with I/O objects
		 (such as sockets).
		- Added a new `async\_result`
		 form with an `initiate`
		 static member function.
		- Updated the Coroutines TS support and promoted it to the `asio` namespace.
		- Added a new `DynamicBuffer\_v2`
		 concept which is CopyConstructible.
		- Added a new `async\_compose`
		 function that simplifies the implementation of user-defined
		 asynchronous operations.
		- Added a `make\_strand`
		 helper function.
		- Relaxed the completion condition type requirements to only
		 require move-constructibility rather than copy-constructibility.
		- Added a constructor for `local::basic\_endpoint`
		 that takes a `string\_view`.
		- Added the noexcept qualifier to various functions.
		- Added a new `BOOST\_ASIO\_DISABLE\_VISIBILITY`
		 configuration `#define`.
		- Enabled recycling of the memory used to type-erase a function
		 object with the polymorphic executor.
		- Changed receive operations to return the correct number of
		 bytes transferred when truncation (`error::message\_size`)
		 occurs on a datagram-oriented socket.
		- Fixed calculation of absolute timeout when the backend uses
		 `pthread\_cond\_timedwait`.
		- Changed the range-based asynchronous connect operation to deduce
		 the `EndpointSequence`
		 iterator type.
		- Fixed `buffer\_sequence\_begin`
		 and `buffer\_sequence\_end`
		 to prevent implicit conversion.
		- Ensured SSL handshake errors are propagated to the peer before
		 the local operation completes.
		- Suppressed the `eof`
		 error on SSL shutdown as it actually indicates success.
		- Added a fallback error code for when we OpenSSL produces an
		 `SSL\_ERROR\_SYSCALL`
		 result without an associated error.
		- Changed composed asynchronous read and write operations to
		 move buffer sequence objects.
		- Fixed a macOS-specific warning about the deprecation of `OSMemoryBarrier`.
		- Fixed compile errors that occur when using the composed read
		 and write operations with MSVC 11.0.
		- Improved `dispatch`,
		 `post` and `defer` documentation.
		- Fixed a Windows-specific memory leak that may occur when `system\_executor` is used.

	+ See the full [Release
	 Notes](/libs/beast/doc/html/beast/release_notes.html) for a complete list of changes.
* [Context](/libs/context/):

	+ [#91](https://github.com/boostorg/context/issues/91): cleanup of stack if creating ucontext fails
	+ [#97](https://github.com/boostorg/context/issues/97): add missing BOST\_CONTEXT\_DECL in stack\_context
	+ [#98](https://github.com/boostorg/context/issues/98): fix jump\_i386\_sysv\_macho writing garbage to the x87
	 control word
* [Coroutine2](/libs/coroutine2/):

	+ [#28](https://github.com/boostorg/coroutine2/issues/28): don't crash on pthread\_cancel
* [DLL](/libs/dll/):

	+ New macro [BOOST\_DLL\_USE\_STD\_FS](/libs/dll/BOOST_DLL_USE_STD_FS.html).
	 Define it to `1` to make
	 the Boost.DLL use C++17's `std::filesystem::path`,
	 `std::system\_error` and `std::error\_code` ([#21](https://github.com/boostorg/dll/issues/21)). Note that
	 exception types change from `boost::system::system\_error`
	 to `std::system\_error`, so make sure to update
	 `catch`es.
	+ Significant rewrite of the dynamic loadable detection and decoration
	 logic. More precise errors are now reported in case of loading failures.
	 Added `shared\_library::decorate()` function that returns a decorated
	 path to the library without doing any platform related queries and
	 detections. Prefer using `shared\_library::load`
	 and `shared\_library`
	 constructors for better results (many thanks to Loïc Touraine for
	 the work [PR#23](https://github.com/boostorg/dll/pull/23)).
	+ CI hardening, docs updates, typos fixes, cleanups and many portability
	 fixes.
* [Dynamic Bitset](/libs/dynamic_bitset/):

	+ Disabled hardware-assisted popcount (added in 1.69.0) on MSVC due
	 to undefined behavior on older CPUs. ([#33](https://github.com/boostorg/dynamic_bitset/issues/33) [PR#35](https://github.com/boostorg/dynamic_bitset/pull/35))
* [Fiber](/libs/fiber/):

	+ [#191](https://github.com/boostorg/fiber/issues/191): ignore unused argument warning
	+ [#196](https://github.com/boostorg/fiber/issues/196): fix high contention on remote\_ready\_splk\_
* [Filesystem](/libs/filesystem/):

	+ Fixed a few instances of dereferencing `std::string::end()` in `path`
	 implementation.
	+ Fixed program termination in case of out of memory condition in directory
	 iterators constructors and operations accepting a reference to `error\_code`. ([#58](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/58))
	+ Fixed possible linking errors caused by missing definitions of static
	 members of `path`.
	 ([#12759](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/12759))
	+ Fixed possible use of uninitialized data in directory iterator increment
	 operation on Linux.
	+ Added support for movability to directory iterators.
	+ Added file status query overloads for `directory\_entry`.
	 This avoids a relatively expensive OS query when file status is requested
	 for a result of dereferencing a directory iterator. ([PR#55](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/pull/55))
	+ Reworked `current\_path`
	 and `read\_symlink`
	 implementation to avoid possible memory exhaustion on broken or tampered
	 with filesystems. The functions now have an internal limit of the
	 path size they will accept from the OS, which is currently 16 MiB.
	+ Increased the size of the internal buffer used by `copy\_file`.
* [Integer](/libs/integer/):

	+ Added Extended Euclidean Algorithm and Modular Multiplicative Inverse
	 function. (Nick Thompson, [PR#11](https://github.com/boostorg/integer/pull/11))
* [Log](/libs/log/):

	+ New features:
	 
		- Added support for generating another log file name before collecting
		 the file in the text file sink backend. This allows to combine
		 appending to an existing log file with timestamps and file
		 counters in log filenames, and, consequently, file collection
		 in general.
	+ See [changelog](/libs/log/doc/html/log/changelog.html)
	 for more details.
* [Math](/libs/math/):

	+ New features:
	 
		- Add Lanczos smoothing derivatives
		- Move `numerical\_differentiation.hpp`
		 from `boost/math/tools/` to `boost/math/differentiation/finite\_difference.hpp`.
		- Add mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, median, Gini coefficient,
		 and median absolute deviation to `tools/univariate\_statistics.hpp`.
		- Add correlation coefficients and covariance to `tools/bivariate\_statistics.hpp`
		- Add absolute Gini coefficient, Hoyer sparsity, oracle SNR,
		 and the *M*[sub 2]*M*[sub
		 4] SNR estimator to `tools/signal\_statistics.hpp`.
		- Add total variation, l0, l1, l2, and sup norms, as well as
		 corresponding distance functions to `tools/norms.hpp`.
		- Add move constructors for polynomials, support complex coefficients,
		 add `.prime()` and `.integrate()`
		 methods.
		- Add `quadratic\_roots`
		 to `tools/roots.hpp`.
		- Add support for complex-valued functions to Newton's method
		 in `roots.hpp`.
		- Add Catmull-Rom interpolator.
* [Mp11](/libs/mp11/):

	+ Renamed `mp\_invoke`
	 to `mp\_invoke\_q`
	+ Added `mp\_similar`
	+ Added `mp\_set\_union`,
	 `mp\_set\_intersection`,
	 `mp\_set\_difference`
	+ Added `mp\_not\_fn`
	+ Added `mp\_transform\_first`,
	 `mp\_transform\_second`,
	 `mp\_transform\_third`
	+ Added `mp\_filter`
	+ Added `mp\_eval\_if\_not`,
	 `mp\_eval\_or`, `mp\_valid\_q`
	+ Added `mp\_back`, `mp\_pop\_back`
* [Multi-index Containers](/libs/multi_index/):

	+ `size\_type` and `difference\_type` are now defined
	 as the allocator's same-named types. This will not make any difference
	 in the vast majority of cases, but allows for some degree of control
	 of resulting internal structures via user-defined allocator types
	 (see issue [#17](https://github.com/boostorg/multi_index/issues/17) for motivation). For the moment being,
	 this change is not documented in the reference section (i.e., it
	 has semi-official status).
	+ Maintenance work.
* [Multiprecision](/libs/multiprecision/):

	+ Fix various conversion issues in the traits classes, check for compatibility
	 with Boost.Optional.
	+ Prevent instantiation of `std::numeric\_limits`
	 on any old type when checking for convertibility. See [#98](https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues/98).
	+ Update variable precision code to account for arbitrary precision
	 integers. See [#103](https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues/103).
	+ Add support for XML serialization archives.
	+ Fix bug in fixed precision iostream formatting in `mpf\_float`
	 and `mpfr\_float`. See
	 [#113](https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues/113).
	+ Add more overloads for special functions which are better handled
	 natively by MPFR.
	+ Fixed bug in generic `exp`
	 implementation which could cause invariant failure.
	+ Fixed generic conversion from float to integer to avoid undefined
	 behaviour. See [#110](https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues/110).
* [PolyCollection](/libs/poly_collection/):

	+ Improved handling of stateful allocators and allocator propagation
	 traits, after an error reported by Billy O'Neal ([PR#9](https://github.com/boostorg/poly_collection/pull/9)).
	+ Fixed a potentially serious bug with an internal cache structure.
* [Spirit](/libs/spirit/):

	+ Removed use of deprecated `boost/detail/iterator.hpp`
	 header. [PR#432](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/pull/432)
	+ X3
	 
		- Integer parsers should now handle user defined types. [PR#429](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/pull/429)
		- **Note:** The `check\_overflow`
		 trait default implementation now relies on `std::numeric\_limits<T>::is\_bounded`
		 instead of `boost::integer\_traits<T>::is\_integral`.
		- Removed sequence into plain parsing. Now it triggers a compile
		 time error instead of silently parsing the the sequence and
		 taking the last value as a result. [PR#439](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/pull/439)
		- Fixed `parse\_rule`
		 instantiation with `BOOST\_SPIRIT\_INSTANTIATE`
		 when:

		- Removed broken 1.0#INF parser. It was poorly documented and
		 never worked. [#415](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/issues/415) [PR#458](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/pull/458) [#8699](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/8699)
		- The undocumented `make\_attribute`
		 trait was removed due to bugs [PR#449](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/pull/449)
		 and to simplify
		 attribute transformation. [PR#460](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/pull/460)
		- If you were using it to workaround bugs in attribute transformation
		 - they should not be needed anymore as of this release.
		- The integer value parser now respects `std::numeric\_limits<T>::digits10`
		 value. [PR#469](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/pull/469)

		Base)
		== 0`
		 corner case. [PR#469](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/pull/469)
		- Fixed an output value on overflow of IgnoreOverflowDigits=true
		 integer parser. [PR#470](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/pull/470)
		- Container attribute elements were copyied, but not moved. [PR#472](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/pull/472)
		- Special handling of references in `transform\_attribute`
		 was removed. [PR#480](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/pull/480)
	+ V2
	 
		- Macro name collisions and namespace conflicts with Boost.Endian
		 were fixed. [PR#349](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/pull/349) [PR#482](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/pull/482)
		- utree
		 
			* Fixed UB in tag getter due to left shift of negative
			 value. [PR#423](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/pull/423)
			* Fixed double-conversion (`spirit::string
			-> std::string
			-> spirit::string`).
			 [PR#462](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/pull/462)
		- Qi
		 
			* Added static asserts for rule skipper type problems.
			 [PR#427](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/pull/427)

			* The undocumented `make\_attribute`
			 trait was merged into `transform\_attribute`
			 trait. [PR#471](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/pull/471)
			* The `pre\_transform`,
			 `post\_transform`,
			 and `fail\_transform`
			 utility functions were removed in favor of directly using
			 `pre`/`post`/`fail` of the transform
			 trait. [PR#467](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/pull/467)
			* The integer value parser now respects `std::numeric\_limits<T>::digits10`
			 value. [PR#469](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/pull/469)

* [TypeIndex](/libs/type_index/):

	+ Support for the GHS C++ compiler added (many thanks to Brandon Castellano
	 for providing the patch [PR#28](https://github.com/boostorg/type_index/pull/28))
	+ Optimized string and type comparisons (many thanks to Andrey Semashev
	 for providing the patch [PR#23](https://github.com/boostorg/type_index/pull/23))
