	+ Consult the [Revision
	 History](/doc/libs/1_79_0/doc/html/boost_asio/history.html) for further details.
* [Assert](/libs/assert/):

	+ `source\_location().file\_name()`
	 and `source\_location().function\_name()` now return `""`
	 instead of `"(unknown)"`.
	+ Added a `source\_location`
	 constructor from `std::source\_location`.
	+ Changed `BOOST\_CURRENT\_LOCATION`
	 to more closely match the behavior of `std::source\_location::current()`, such as being usable at top level
	 or as a default function argument.

	+ Fixed compilation for Universal Windows Platform (UWP). ([#54](https://github.com/boostorg/atomic/issues/54))
	+ Added `BOOST\_ATOMIC\_NO\_DARWIN\_ULOCK`
	 configuration macro. The macro affects compilation on Darwin systems
	 and disables `ulock`-based
	 implementation of waiting and notifying operations. This may be useful
	 to comply with Apple App Store requirements. ([#55](https://github.com/boostorg/atomic/issues/55))

	+ Added individual tests to CMake workflow.
	+ We'd love to know how you or your company use Beast, consider adding
	 an entry to the [Companies
	 and Individuals Using Beast](https://github.com/boostorg/beast/wiki/Companies-and-Individuals-Using-Beast) list.
	+ See the full [Release
	 Notes](/libs/beast/doc/html/beast/release_notes.html) for a complete list of changes.
* [Core](/libs/core/):

	+ Made `boost::pointer\_traits` SFINAE friendly,
	 addressing LWG3545. (Glen Fernandes)
	+ Added `boost::allocator\_traits` that uses the
	 individual allocator access traits. This implementation supports
	 C++03 and above. (Glen Fernandes)
	+ Updated the allocator access traits to support most of the C++11
	 allocator model in C++03. (Glen Fernandes)
	+ `boost/iterator.hpp` is deprecated and will be removed
	 in a future release. The header defines `boost::iterator`
	 template, which is equivalent to `std::iterator`
	 in `<iterator>` header. However, since `std::iterator` is itself deprecated in
	 C++17, users are advised to remove `boost::iterator`
	 or `std::iterator` use from their code.
	+ Added `boost::core::verbose\_terminate\_handler`, a utility
	 function intended to be passed to `std::set\_terminate`
	 that prints information about the uncaught exception to `stderr`.
* [Describe](/libs/describe/):

	+ Enabled unions in `BOOST\_DESCRIBE\_STRUCT`
	 and updated examples to check `std::is\_union<T>`.
	+ Added example of defining a `fmtlib`
	 class formatter.
	+ Added example of defining a `fmtlib`
	 enum formatter.
	+ Added example of printing pointers to members.
* [Filesystem](/libs/filesystem/):

	+ **v3:** `path::replace\_extension`
	 now works in terms of **v3** definition
	 of `path::extension` rather than **v4**.
	+ Fixed compilation of path appending and concatenation operators with
	 arguments of types convertible to `path`
	 or compatible string type. ([#223](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/223))
	+ On POSIX systems that support `fdopendir`
	 and `O\_NOFOLLOW` and
	 on Windows, `remove\_all`
	 is now protected against [CVE-2022-21658](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21658).
	 The vulnerability is a race condition that allows a third party process
	 to replace a directory that is being concurrently processed by `remove\_all` with a directory symlink
	 and cause `remove\_all`
	 to follow the symlink and remove files in the linked directory instead
	 of removing the symlink itself. ([#224](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/224))
	+ On Windows, in `remove`
	 and `remove\_all` implementation,
	 use POSIX semantics for file removal, when supported by the OS (Windows
	 10 1709 and later). When POSIX semantics is supported, the file name
	 is removed from the filesystem namespace as soon as the file is marked
	 for deletion, even if it is still open and in use. With legacy Windows
	 semantics, the file name remains present in the the filesystem namespace
	 until the last file handle to the file is closed, which allows the
	 file marked for deletion to be opened and prevents creating new files
	 with the same name. ([#216](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/216))
	+ On Windows, `remove`
	 and `remove\_all` now
	 support deleting read-only directories. Support for removing read-only
	 non-directory files was added previously.
	+ On Windows, `directory\_iterator`
	 internal implementation has been reworked to better utilize modern
	 Windows APIs, which may improve performance while handling symlinks.
	+ On Windows, initialize internal WinAPI function pointers early, if
	 possible, to allow Boost.Filesystem operations to be invoked in global
	 constructors. This is only supported on MSVC, GCC, Clang and compatible
	 compilers.
	+ On Windows, `resize\_file`
	 should no longer fail with an error if the file to be resized is
	 opened.
	+ Disabled use of the `statx`
	 syscall on Android prior to 11.0 (API version 30). The syscall is
	 blacklisted by seccomp and causes process termination in runtime.
	 ([#229](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/229))
	+ **Deprecated:** `boost/filesystem/string\_file.hpp`
	 header is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The
	 header is no longer included by `boost/filesystem.hpp`
	 by default. Users are advised to implement the functionality themselves
	 or migrate to other implementations.
	+ **Deprecated:** Windows CE support is
	 deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Windows CE has
	 been untested for many years and is likely non-functional.
* [Geometry](/libs/geometry/):

	+ Major change
	 
		- [PR#977](https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/pull/977) Rescaling is turned off by default. This avoids

* [Integer](/libs/integer/):

	+ Optimized `integer\_log2`
	 implementation to use bit operations internally. This allows to employ
	 bit instructions available on most modern CPUs. ([#31](https://github.com/boostorg/integer/issues/31))
* [IO](/libs/io/):

	+ Added `boost::io::basic\_nullbuf`, a null stream buffer,
	 and `boost::basic\_onullstream`, a null output
	 stream (Glen Fernandes).

	+ In `counting\_iterator`,
	 added support for built-in 128-bit integer types supported by gcc
	 and clang and compatible compilers on some target platforms.
	+ Silenced gcc warnings about deprecated implicit copy assignment operator
	 in `counting\_iterator`.
* [JSON](/libs/json/):

	+ Standalone mode of the library is removed. Users who wish to continue
	 using standalone JSON can switch to [the
	 C++ Alliance fork](https://github.com/CPPAlliance/standalone-json.git).
	+ Add `std::error\_code` overloads.
	+ Add `boost::source\_location` to `error\_codes`.
	+ Add support for JSON Pointer.
	+ Naturally grow string during serialization.

	+ Support for FreeRTOS and other embedded platforms
	+ Improved diagnostic information
	+ Improved configuration macros
	+ BOOST\_LEAF\_CHECK using statement expressions under \_\_GNUC\_\_
	+ Fixed symbol demangling bug
* [Log](/libs/log/):

	+ General changes:
	 
		- In `text\_file\_backend`,
		 added support for appending to a previously written log file,
		 when file rotation is used and log file names use file counters.
		- **Breaking change:** The `file\_collector` interface
		 has changed:
		 
			* `scan\_for\_files`
			 method returns a `scan\_result`
			 structure that contains information collected during
			 the scan;
			* `is\_in\_storage`
			 method added for testing if a path refers to a file within
			 the target storage directory.
		- Added a new `invoke\_manip`
		 stream manipulator that can be used for injecting user's function
		 into a stream output expression.
	+ Bug fixes:
	 
		- Fixed file counter being set to zero if the user calls `text\_file\_backend::scan\_for\_files` multiple times,
		 and the second and the following calls don't find any new files.
		 ([#179](https://github.com/boostorg/log/issues/179))

	 overloads for `errc::errc\_t`,
	 `std::error\_code`, `std::errc`,
	 `std::exception\_ptr`.
	+ `result<T>::value` now automatically supplies

	 to `throw\_exception\_from\_error`
	 via a default argument.
	+ Added an `errc::make\_error\_code` overload taking
	 a source location.
* [ThrowException](/libs/throw_exception/):
