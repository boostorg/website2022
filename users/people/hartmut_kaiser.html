 After 15+ interesting years that Hartmut spent working in
 industrial software development, he still tremendously enjoys
 working with modern software development technologies and
 techniques. His preferred field of interest is the software
 development in the area of object-oriented and component-based
 programming in C++ and its application in complex contexts,
 such as for spatial information systems, internet based
 applications and parser technologies. Hartmut enjoys using and
 learning about modern C++ programming techniques, such as
 template based generic and meta-programming and preprocessor
 based meta-programming.
