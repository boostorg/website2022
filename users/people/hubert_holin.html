Hubert Holin
============

![-](hubert_holin.jpg)
 Hubert Holin is a mathematician. He is currently a civil
 servant of the french state (no longer indentured, but still
 stuck). He has also worked as a developper in a small french
 start-up , and as a math teacher in a private non-religious
 higher-ed school.


His first programs were in assembly language/micro-code on
 an Hewlett-Packard [HP 25](http://www.hpmuseum.org/hp25.htm) hand-held calculator (a marked
 improvement over his father's use of binary-on-strips-of-paper
 on some forgoten piece of metal...), back in the mists of time.
 He is a Mac-using refugee of the Atari, and on a personal jihad
 against The Evil Empire Of Computing ™.


Very much a Child of the World, he has lived in Europe,
 Africa, the U.S.A., and is married with a chinese girl (with
 whom he has both a daughter and a son).
