### New Libraries


* [Iostreams
 Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/iostreams/doc/index.html):
 Framework for defining streams, stream buffers and i/o
 filters, from Jonathan Turkanis.
* [Functional/Hash
 Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/functional/hash/index.html): A TR1 hash function object that can be extended to hash
 user defined types, from Daniel James.
* [Parameter
 Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/parameter/doc/html/index.html):
 Write functions that accept arguments by name: especially
 useful when a function has more than one argument with a useful default
 value, since named arguments can be passed in any order.
* [Pointer
 Container Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/ptr_container/index.html):
 Containers for storing heap-allocated polymorphic
 objects to ease OO-programming, from Thorsten Ottosen.
* [Wave](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/wave/index.html): Standards
 conformant implementation of the mandated C99/C++ preprocessor functionality
 packed behind an easy to use iterator interface, from Hartmut Kaiser.

### Updated Libraries


* [Any Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/doc/html/any.html): `any\_cast` has been enhanced to allow direct
 access to `any`'s held value.
* [Assignment
 Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/assign/doc/index.html): Support for [Pointer
 Container Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/ptr_container/index.html) and new efficient functions `ref\_list\_of()` and `cref\_list\_of()` for generating anonymous ranges.
* [Bind Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/bind/bind.html): Bind
 expressions now support [comparisons
 and negation](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/bind/bind.html#operators). Example: `bind(&X::name, \_1) < bind(&X::name, \_2)`.
* [Date-Time
 Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/doc/html/date_time.html):

	+ Added [local
	 time and time zone classes](/doc/libs/1_33_1/doc/html/date_time/local_time.html).
	+ Added [format-based
	 Input/Output facets](/doc/libs/1_33_1/doc/html/date_time/date_time_io.html).
	+ For a complete list of changes, see the library [change
	 history](/doc/libs/1_33_1/doc/html/date_time/details.html#date_time.changes).
* [Graph Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/graph/doc/index.html): Introduced
 several new algorithms and improved existing algorithms:
 
	+ [Experimental
	 Python bindings](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/graph/doc/python.html), from Doug Gregor and Indiana University.
	+ [`floyd warshall
	all pairs
	shortest paths`](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/graph/doc/floyd_warshall_shortest.html),
	 from Lauren Foutz and Scott Hill.
	+ [`astar search`](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/graph/doc/astar_search.html),
	 from Kristopher Beevers and Jufeng Peng.
	+ [`fruchterman reingold
	force directed
	layout`](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/graph/doc/fruchterman_reingold.html), from Doug
	 Gregor and Indiana University.
	+ [`biconnected components`
	 and `articulation points`](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/graph/doc/biconnected_components.html), from Jeremy Siek,
	 Janusz Piwowarski, and Doug Gregor.
	+ [`sequential vertex
	coloring`](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/graph/doc/sequential_vertex_coloring.html) has been
	 updated, tested, and documented.
	+ [`gursoy atun
	layout`](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/graph/doc/gursoy_atun_layout.html), from Jeremiah
	 Willcock and Doug Gregor of Indiana University.
	+ [`king ordering`](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/graph/doc/king_ordering.html),
	 from D. Kevin McGrath of Indiana University.
	+ [`cuthill mckee
	ordering`](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/graph/doc/cuthill_mckee_ordering.html) has been
	 recast as an invocation of `breadth
	first search`
	 and now supports graphs with multiple components.
	+ [`dijkstra shortest
	paths`](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/graph/doc/dijkstra_shortest_paths.html) now uses
	 a relaxed heap [[61](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/graph/doc/bibliography.html#driscoll88)]
	 as its priority queue, improving its complexity to O(V log V) and
	 improving real-world performance for larger graphs.
	+ [`read graphviz`](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/graph/doc/read_graphviz.html)
	 now has a new, Spirit-based parser that works for all graph types
	 and supports arbitrary properties on the graph, from Ron Garcia.
	 The old, Bison-based GraphViz reader has been deprecated and will
	 be removed in a future Boost release. [`write graphviz`](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/graph/doc/write-graphviz.html)
	 also supports dynamic properties.
	+ [`subgraph`](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/graph/doc/subgraph.html): `get\_property` now refers to the
	 subgraph property, not the root graph's property.
	+ See the [history](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/graph/doc/history.html#by-version)
	 for additional changes and bug fixes.
* [Multi-index
 Containers Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/multi_index/doc/index.html):

	+ New [hashed
	 indices](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/multi_index/doc/tutorial/indices.html#hashed_indices).
	+ Added [serialization
	 support](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/multi_index/doc/tutorial/creation.html#serialization).
	+ For a complete list of changes, see the library [release
	 notes](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/multi_index/doc/release_notes.html).
* [Program
 Options Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/program_options/doc/index.html):

	+ Option descriptions are now printed with word wrapping.
	+ Command line parser can bypass unregistered options, instread of
	 throwing.
	+ Removed support for "implicit" (optional) values.
	+ New customization method 'command\_line\_parser::extra\_style\_parser'.
	 Unlike 'additional\_parser', allows the user to parse several tokens
	 and return a vector of options, not just a single option.
	+ Work with disabled exceptions.
* [Property
 Map Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/property_map/property_map.html): Introduced the [`dynamic properties`](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/property_map/doc/dynamic_property_map.html)
 class, which provides dynamically-typed access to a set of property maps.
* [Boost.Python](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/python/doc/index.html):

	+ Added support for docstrings on nonstatic properties.
	+ We now export the client-provided docstrings for `init<optional<> >`
	 and *XXX*`\_FUNCTION\_OVERLOADS()` for only the last overload.
	+ Support for Embedded VC++ 4 and GCC-3.3 on MacOS added
	+ Introduced better support for rvalue from-python conversions of shared\_ptr.
	+ Support for exposing `vector<T\*>` with the indexing suite.
	+ updated visual studio project build file.
	+ Added search feature to the index page.
* [Random Number
 Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/random/index.html):
 Improved initialization for `mersenne\_twister`,
 algorithm by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura, implemented for Boost
 by Jens Maurer.


Note: All test vectors for `mersenne\_twister`s
 constructed or seeded without parameters or with a single `unsigned int`
 parameter become invalid.
* [Range Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/range/index.html): Minor
 addition of convenience functions to `iterator
range` like `front(), back()` and `operator[]()`.
* [Regex Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/regex/index.html):

	+ Rewritten front end parser now supports (?imsx-imsx) constructs,
	 plus lookbehind assertions and conditional expressions.
	+ Thin wrapper classes improve integration with MFC/ATL code.
	+ Full (optional) Unicode support via the ICU library. Refer to the
	 [regex history
	 page](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/regex/doc/history.html) for more information on these and other small changes.
* [Serialization
 Library](/doc/libs/1_33_1/libs/serialization/doc/index.html):

	+ DLL version.
	+ Auto-linking.
	+ Serialization of variants.
	+ Improved serialization of shared pointers.

 slot blocking/unblocking, from Frantz Maerten. Huge improvements to signal
 invocation performance from Robert Zeh.

### Supported Compilers
 Boost is tested on a wide range of compilers and platforms. Since Boost libraries
 rely on modern C++ features not available in all compilers, not all Boost libraries
 will work with every compiler. The following compilers and platforms have been
 extensively tested with Boost, although many other compilers and platforms
 will work as well. For more information, see the [regression
 test results](https://www.boost.org/regression/release/user/).
 


* [Apple GCC](http://developer.apple.com/) 3.x on Mac OS
 X.
* [Borland C++](http://www.codegear.com/products/cppbuilder)
 5.6.4 on Windows.
* [GNU C++](http://gcc.gnu.org) 2.95.3 (with and without
 STLport), 3.2.x., 3.3.x, 3.4.x, 4.0.x on Windows, Linux and Solaris.
* [Intel
 C++](http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/compilers/index.htm) 8.1, 9.0 on Windows, Linux.
* [Metrowerks CodeWarrior](http://www.metrowerks.com) 8.3,
 9.4, 9.5 on Mac OS X and Windows.
* [Microsoft Visual C++](http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/)
 6.0 (sp5, with and without STLport), 7.0, 7.1, 8.0 beta. Note: due to intermittent
 problems with Visual C++ 8.0 beta, and the presence of a variety of pre-release
 compiler builds, we are unable to guarantee compatibility until the final
 compiler is released.
