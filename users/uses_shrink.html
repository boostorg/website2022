Shrink Wrapped Boost



Shrink Wrapped Boost
====================

Boost has found it's way into many products that are
 available "off the shelf", including consumer applications from
 Adobe, through to business middleware from SAP.


Adobe Photoshop CS2
-------------------


[Adobe
 Photoshop CS2](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/index.html) uses the [Adobe Software Libraries](http://opensource.adobe.com/),
 which in turn depend upon large parts of Boost. The [Adobe Software
 Libraries](http://opensource.adobe.com/) are being rolled out across the Adobe product
 line to provide cross platform user interface logic.


Adobe Indesign
--------------


[Adobe
 Indesign](http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/index.html) offers best of breed page design: Indesign and
 it's asociated SDK depend upon Boost [Boost.Regex](../doc/libs/release/libs/regex/index.html),
 [Boost.Functional](../doc/libs/release/libs/functional/index.html)
 and others.


SAP NetWeaver
-------------


[SAP
 NetWeaver](http://www.sap.com/platform/netweaver/index.epx) is the technical foundation of mySAP Business
 Suite solutions, SAP xApps composite applications, partner
 solutions, and customer custom-built applications. [Boost.Regex](../doc/libs/release/libs/regex/index.html)
 provides the regular expression implementation for SAP's
 [ABAP
 language](https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/sdn?node=linkDnode6-3).


Real Networks, Rhapsody
-----------------------


The [Rhapsody
 Music Service](http://www.real.com/) allows its subscribers to legally
 download/transfer/burn over a million songs. The Rhapsody
 client software was built with many Boost libraries:


[Boost.Format](../doc/libs/release/libs/format/index.html):
 Boost.Format is top notch. Using it is a bliss.


[Boost.Functional](../doc/libs/release/libs/functional/index.html),
 [Boost.Function](../doc/libs/release/libs/function/index.html),
 and [Boost.Bind](../doc/libs/release/libs/bind/index.html):
 These three libraries, along with [Boost.SmartPointers](../doc/libs/release/libs/smart_ptr/index.html)
 are the most used in our application. I could not imagine not
 having them handy.


[Boost.SmartPointers](../doc/libs/release/libs/smart_ptr/index.html):
 Hands down, the most useful, and used library of the lot!


[Boost.DateTime](../doc/libs/release/libs/date_time/index.html):
 Simple to use, effective, does the job. I love the flexible
 input string parsing facilities, and the human readable ISO
 output.


[Boost.Iterator](../doc/libs/release/libs/iterator/index.html):
 Wow. Moving legacy iterating interfaces, or interfaces that
 should of been properly designed as iterators to STL compliant
 iterators was easy and painless. The gains in functionality to
 our code made by this library are invaluable.


[Boost.Regex](../doc/libs/release/libs/regex/index.html):
 When you need it, it works magic.


[Boost.Thread](../doc/libs/release/libs/thread/index.html):
 Used to implement the monitor pattern in key areas.


[Boost.Preprocessor](../doc/libs/release/libs/preprocessor/index.html):
 Used to implement repetitive unit-test code generation. The
 codebase benefited greatly from the clarity [Boost.Preprocessor](../doc/libs/release/libs/preprocessor/index.html)
 brought.


Skyjuice Software, Quick File Rename
------------------------------------
[Skyjuice Software](http://www.skyjuicesoftware.com)
[Quick File Rename](http://www.skyjuicesoftware.com/software/QuickFileRename)
 is a unicode batch file and
 folder renamer which allows photo collectors and audiophiles to rename
 thousands of files and folders in seconds. Users can tag audio files,
 extract meta data information for photos, and perform other batch rename
 operations to allow better categorisation of files and folders in Windows
 Explorer. Complex rename operations can be combined into a single step
 using a rules system. A command line mode is also supported.
 Parts of boost used: All regular expressions used in Quick File Rename are
 parsed by
 [Boost.Regex](../doc/libs/release/libs/random/index.html). 
 This provided us with tremendous power for the text
 manipulation that is used frequently in both in the GUI and console modes.
 


DataSolid GmbH Germany, CADdy++ Mechanical Design (c)
-----------------------------------------------------


[CADdy++
 Mechanical Design professional (c)](http://www.DataSolid.com) is a fully parametric 3D
 CAD application with unbroken link between 3D models and 2D
 drawings. CADdy++ uses the Boost libraries: [Boost.Any](../doc/libs/release/libs/any/index.html),

Dr. Detlef Meyer-Eltz, TextTransformer
--------------------------------------


The [TextTransformer](http://www.texttransformer.com) is a
 Windows IDE for the generation of top down parsers with
 included c++ interpreter code for semantic actions. Both can be
 executed or debugged immediately on single source files or on
 groups of files. Generated parsers can be exported as c++ code
 including as well the interpretable code as any arbitrary other
 code. Tokens are defined as POSIX regular expressions and rules
 are defined in a similar syntax quasi as regular expressions of
 regular expressions. The construction of parse trees and their
 traversal is supported.


*"The TextTransformer is essentially based on the
 [Boost.Regex](../doc/libs/release/libs/regex/index.html),
 by which the tokens for a parser can be defined. The [Boost.LexicalCast](../doc/libs/release/libs/conversion/lexical_cast.htm)
 and the Format library are used for the integrated c++
 interpreter. For the future also an interpreter version of the
 [Boost.StringAlgorithms](../doc/libs/release/libs/algorithm/string/index.html)
 is planned. The [Boost.ProgramOptions](../doc/libs/release/libs/program_options/index.html)
 library will be used too to improve the command line version of
 the texttransformer."*


Redshift Software, The Thot Tool

[Paragent
 Manage](http://www.paragent.com/) is a Desktop Management Application that uses a
 lightweight agent written in C++. Unlike traditional desktop
 management solutions, Paragent Manage avoids the complexity and
 cost of servers by using peer-to-peer communication between
 agents and the administrative console. This allows real-time
 inventory searching, alerting and software auditing in an
 easy-to-deploy and maintain package.


*"We have used Boost extensively throughout our agent,
 including: [Boost.Thread](../doc/libs/release/libs/thread/index.html),
 [Boost.SharedPointer](../doc/libs/release/libs/smart_ptr/index.html),
 [Boost.Bind](../doc/libs/release/libs/bind/index.html),

 [Boost.MultiIndex](../doc/libs/release/libs/multi_index/index.html),
 [Boost.FileSystem](../doc/libs/release/libs/filesystem/index.html).*


*"Apart from some read\_write\_mutex issues we had, Boost
 has been a seamless part of our development, and has allowed us
 to develop and deploy a very complex, highly threaded
 networking agent with a built-in lisp-like xml-based scripting
 language all done in C++. Our entire development team would
 like to thank everyone for their hard work on behalf of C++
 coders everywhere."*
