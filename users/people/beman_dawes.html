===========

![-](beman_dawes.jpg) Beman
 Dawes was a software developer from Virginia in the United
 States and the founder of boost.org and BoostCon (now known as
 C++Now).


He was the author of the StreetQuick® geographic atlas
 library used by digital map publishers to help people get
 really, really, lost.


He wrote his first computer program 50 years ago, and did
 not mourn the passing of [bi-quinary](http://www.mta.ca/~amiller/ibm650/ibm650.htm) arithmetic.


Beman was a voting member of the ISO C++ Standards
 Committee for twenty eight years, and chaired the Library Working
 Group for five years.


He enjoyed travel, sailing, hiking, and biking.


Beman passed away on December first, 2020 and was survived by
 his wife Sonda.
