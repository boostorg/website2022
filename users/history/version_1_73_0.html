### Known Issues
 These are patches from library authors which were found too late to be fixed
 in the release. Be careful as they have not been through the normal testing
 process.
 


* Outcome `status\_code\_domain`
 assertion removal
 
	+ [Outcome patch](/patches/1_73_0/0001-outcome-assert.patch)
* Beast and coroutines
 
	+ [Beast patch](/patches/1_73_0/0002-beast-coroutines.patch)

### New Libraries


* [Nowide](/libs/nowide/): Standard library functions
 with UTF-8 API on Windows, from Artyom Beilis.
* [StaticString](/libs/static_string/): A dynamically
 resizable string of characters with compile-time fixed capacity and contiguous
 embedded storage, from Vinnie Falco and Krystian Stasiowski

### Updated Libraries


* [Align](/libs/align/):

	+ Update `aligned\_alloc`
	 to support older mingw32.
* [Any](/libs/any/):

	+ Speedup compilation by not including `<algorithm>`.
	+ Maintenance work, including CI hardening.
* [Asio](/libs/asio/):

	+ Fixed compatibility with C++20 concept syntax.
	+ Marked the POSIX descriptor classes' move constructors as `noexcept`.
	+ Added the `ssl::host\_name\_verification` class, which
	 is a drop-in replacement for `ssl::rfc2818\_verification`.
	 The `ssl::rfc2818\_verification` class has
	 been marked as deprecated. As a consequence of this change, SSL support
	 now depends on functions that were introduced in OpenSSL 1.0.2.
	+ Added an `ssl::context` constructor to take ownership
	 of a native handle.
	+ Changed C++ language version detection with gcc
	 to use `\_\_cplusplus`
	 macro.
	+ Fixed a work counting issue in the asynchronous resolve operation
	 for endpoints.
	+ Fixed the `strand<>` converting constructors and
	 assignment operators.
	+ Ensured that resolvers are restarted correctly after a fork.
	+ Fixed compatibility with the current NetBSD release.
	+ Removed spurious handler requirement checks in some `async\_read` overloads.
	+ Changed the `ssl::context` class to propagate non-EOF
	 errors from the `add\_certificate\_authority`
	 function.
	+ Fixed a Windows-specific `thread\_pool`
	 destructor hang that occurred when the pool had an associated I/O
	 object.
	+ Changed the select reactor to recreate the "self
	 pipe trick" sockets on error. This addresses an issue on some
	 versions of Windows, where these sockets are discconected after a
	 system sleep.
	+ Fixed a compile error in the buffered streams due to the lack of
	 reference collapsing in C++98.
	+ Changed the `priority\_scheduler`
	 example to demonstrate calls to `shutdown()` and `destroy()`.
	+ Removed some unnecessary null pointer checks.
	+ Changed Windows platform detection to recognise TV titles as Windows
	 apps.
	+ Added some emscripten compatibility patches.
	+ Fixed a compile error in the `use\_awaitable\_t::as\_default\_on`
	 function.
	+ Changed all uses of the boost.bind placeholders to use the `boost::placeholders` namespace.
	+ Fixed a potential compile error in the `async\_compose`
	 implementation due to incorrect overload selection.
	+ Suppressed some non-virtual destructor warnings.
	+ Various documentation fixes and improvements.
* [Assert](/libs/assert/):

	+ Added `source\_location`.
* [Atomic](/libs/atomic/):

	+ Implemented C++20 `atomic\_ref`.
	 See [docs](/doc/html/atomic/interface.html#atomic.interface.interface_atomic_ref)
	 and especially the [caveats](/doc/html/atomic/interface.html#atomic.interface.interface_atomic_ref.caveats)
	 section.
	+ Implemented `atomic\_flag::test`
	 operation, which was introduced in C++20.
	+ `atomic<T>`
	 should now take into account alignment requirements of `T`, which makes a difference if
	 those requirements are higher than that of the internal storage of
	 `atomic`.
	+ Added static asserts enforcing the requirements on the value type
	 `T` used with `atomic` and `atomic\_ref`.
	 This should prohibit invalid types from being used as atomics.
	+ Improved internal lock pool implementation. The pool is larger, and
	 lock selection accounts for atomic object alignment, which should
	 reduce the potential of thread contention.
	+ Fixed incorrect x86 code generated for `bit\_test\_and\_\*` operations on 8 and 16-bit arguments.
	 Other architectures are not affected.
	+ Fixed a possible unaligned memory access in `compare\_exchange\_\*` operations, if alignment requirements
	 of `value\_type` are
	 less than that of the internal storage of `atomic`.
	+ `boost/atomic/atomic.hpp` no longer includes `boost/atomic/atomic\_flag.hpp` and `boost/atomic/fences.hpp`
	 and only defines the `boost::atomic`
	 class template and related typedefs. Include the other headers explicitly
	 or use `boost/atomic.hpp` to include all parts of Boost.Atomic.
	+ The `atomic<T>::storage()`
	 accessor and associated `atomic<T>::storage\_type`
	 type are deprecated. Instead, users are advised to use `atomic<T>::value()`
	 and `atomic<T>::value\_type`, respectively. Users
	 can define `BOOST\_ATOMIC\_SILENCE\_STORAGE\_DEPRECATION`
	 to disable deprecation warnings for the time of transition. The deprecated
	 pieces will be removed in a future release.
	+ Removed support for `BOOST\_ATOMIC\_DETAIL\_HIGHLIGHT\_OP\_AND\_TEST`.
	 This macro was used as a helper for transition to the updated returned
	 values of `\*\_and\_test`
	 operations in Boost.Atomic 1.67, which was released 2 years before
	 1.73.
* [Beast](/libs/beast/):

	+ This is a maintenance update.
	+ Nested `mutable\_data\_type`
	 in Beast dynamic buffers is deprecated.
	+ We'd love to know how you or your company use Beast, consider adding
	 an entry to the [Companies
	 and Individuals Using Beast](https://github.com/boostorg/beast/wiki/Companies-and-Individuals-Using-Beast) list.
	+ See the full [Release
	 Notes](/libs/beast/doc/html/beast/release_notes.html) for a complete list of changes.

	 (thanks to Julien Delacroix for the patch).
	+ Significant docs update.
* [date\_time](/libs/date_time/):

	+ [#123](https://github.com/boostorg/date_time/issues/123): Support constexpr in c++14 and above
	+ [#134](https://github.com/boostorg/date_time/issues/134): Make date\_time all inline. Users no longer need
	 to link the library for any functions. Library remains for build
	 compatibility.
	+ [#132](https://github.com/boostorg/date_time/issues/132): Deprecate support for legacy io and `USE\_DATE\_TIME\_PRE\_1\_33\_FACET\_IO`
	 macro
	+ Misc documentation updates and bugfixes.
* [DLL](/libs/dll/):

	+ Fixes and tests for demangling in `boost::dll::smart\_library`
	 (thanks to Ramil Gauss for [#35](https://github.com/boostorg/dll/issues/35)).
	+ Make UB sanitizers happy with `boost::dll::load\_mode::type`
	[#30](https://github.com/boostorg/dll/issues/30).
	+ Ceased dependence on MPL improving compile times (thanks to Nikita
	 Kniazev for [#34](https://github.com/boostorg/dll/issues/34)).
	+ Clang and ICC on Windows fixes and CI support for those platforms
	 (thanks to Nikita Kniazev [#33](https://github.com/boostorg/dll/issues/33)).
	+ Maintenance work, including CI hardening and tests improving.
* [Dynamic Bitset](/libs/dynamic_bitset/):

	+ Fixed a portability issue in the definition of the maximum block
	 limit.

	+ Added
	 
		- Added move constructor and move assignment operator to `image` class ([PR#457](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/457)).
		- New member function `size()` in `any\_image\_view`
		 class ([PR#456](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/456)).
	+ Changed
	 
		- Replace Boost.Test with Boost.LightweightTest as the only test
		 framework used in GIL ([PR#459](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/459)) and ([PR#464](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/464)). This
		 also restructured the `test/extension/io/` sub-tree and targets in related
		 `Jamfile`-s.

		 Instead, if a test target is built, it builds all its test
		 cases unconditionally.
	+ Fixed
	 
		- Avoid `longjmp`
		 interaction during destruction of I/O extension objects ([PR#433](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/433)).

		- Fixed illegal initialization of return values in the old IOv1
		 interface of I/O extension ([PR#409](https://github.com/boostorg/gil/pull/409)).
	+ Acknowledgements
	 
		- Samuel Debionne, Thiago Henrique Hüpner, Pranam Lashkari,
		 Mateusz Loskot, Debabrata Mandal, Olzhas Zhumabek

	+ New features
	 
		- Added `crop`
		 command to `reduce`
		 algorithm
		- `slice` command
		 in `reduce` now
		 works on `category`
		 axis
		- Added `count`
		 accumulator, can be used to add arbitrary metadata to each
		 cell
		- `sum` algorithm
		 gained a new argument to optionally sum only over inner bins
	+ Several fixes for bugs in corner cases
	+ Enhanced documentation
	 
		- How to use Boost.Histogram as a backend in an external API
		- More on how to use Boost.Histogram with custom accumulators
		 and Boost.Accumulators
		- More on how to use `reduce`
		- Updated benchmarks
	+ See the [full
	 changelog here](/libs/histogram/doc/html/histogram/history.html)
* [icl](/libs/icl/):

	+ [PR#23](https://github.com/boostorg/icl/pull/23): Remove references to date\_time compiled library.
	+ [PR#17](https://github.com/boostorg/icl/pull/17): Fix forward decl lower and upper less equal.
	+ Misc bugfixes.
* [IO](/libs/io/):

	+ Made all the IOS state saver classes non-copyable. (Glen Fernandes)
	+ Correctly handle error upon first read from the input stream when
	 reading a quoted string. (Glen Fernandes)
	+ Implemented `ostream\_joiner`
	 for delimiter based joining. (Glen Fernandes)
	+ Relocated `ostream\_string`
	 from the Utility library to the IO library as `ostream\_put`.
	+ Correctly handle stream width and fill in quoted output. (Glen Fernandes)
	+ Optimize quoted output to write directly to the stream buffer. (Glen
	 Fernandes)
	+ Glen Fernandes became the maintainer of the IO library.
* [LexicalCast](/libs/lexical_cast/):

	+ Maintenance work, including CI hardening and better workarounds for
	 broken standard libraries (thanks to Nikita Kniazev [#31](https://github.com/boostorg/lexical_cast/issues/31),
	 [#32](https://github.com/boostorg/lexical_cast/issues/32)).
* [Log](/libs/log/):

	+ New Features:
	 
		- Default sink used in trivial logging, when no sinks are registered
		 in the logging core, now automatically flushes output after
		 each log record. ([#103](https://github.com/boostorg/log/issues/103))
		- `core::flush` now performs a flush
		 on the default sink used for trivial logging, when no sinks
		 are registered.
	+ Bug fixes:
	 
		- Added a workaround for some syslog API implementations (e.g.
		 glibc), which do not save the application identification string
		 in `openlog`
		 call. Such implementations could access already freed memory
		 on each `syslog`
		 call, resulting in undefined behavior. ([#97](https://github.com/boostorg/log/issues/97))
		- Fixed that log file rotation on a specific day of month (e.g.
		 `rotation\_at\_time\_point(boost::gregorian::greg\_day(1))`) could be silently ignored
		 and not happen. ([#98](https://github.com/boostorg/log/issues/98))
		- Fixed that `text\_file\_backend::rotate\_file`
		 could throw if there were no log records written yet and target
		 file name pattern was set.
		- Ported various components of the library to `std::allocator\_traits`
		 to improve compatibility with C++20 allocators.
		- Fixed compilation errors when building in MSYS2 Cygwin environment.
		 ([#102](https://github.com/boostorg/log/issues/102))
	+ See [changelog](/libs/log/doc/html/log/changelog.html)
	 for more details.
* [Math](/libs/math/):

	+ IMPORTANT: C++03 support is now deprecated and will be removed from
	 March 2021.
	+ Added Cubic Hermite Interpolation.
	+ Added Modified Akima Interpolation.
	+ Added PCHIP Interpolation.
	+ Added Quintic Hermite Interpolation.
	+ Added entropy to numerous distributions.
	+ Allow trivial quadrature case where the two end points are equal,
	 and in addition allow bounds to be interchanged.
	+ Fix exp\_sinh quadrature to work with complex types over a non-native
	 range.
	+ Fix miscellaneous compiler warnings in factorial.hpp.
	+ Use std::chrono rather than boost::chrono in timed pFq calculations.
	+ Remove much of the old boost::mpl dependencies to improve constexpr
	 support.
* [Mp11](/libs/mp11/):

	+ Added `mp\_unique\_if`
	 (contributed by Kris Jusiak)
	+ Added `mp\_flatten`
	+ Added `mp\_rotate\_left`,
	 `mp\_rotate\_right` (contributed
	 by Duncan Barber)
	+ Added `mp\_compose`
	+ Added `mp\_power\_set`
	+ Added `mp\_partial\_sum`
	+ Added `mp\_iterate`
* [Multi-index Containers](/libs/multi_index/):

	+ `multi\_index\_container`
	 is now [`AllocatorAware`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/AllocatorAwareContainer).
	+ Swapping of internal `KeyFromValue`,
	 `Compare`, `Hash` and `Pred`
	 objects now selects the appropriate `swap`
	 function between `std::swap`
	 and ADL candidates, in accordance with standard specifications in
	 **[swappable.requirements]** (issue
	 [#29](https://github.com/boostorg/multi_index/issues/29)).
	+ Provided some internal copy constructors and assignment operators
	 whose default implicit definition is deprecated in C++11 onwards
	 (**[depr.impldec]**), which was warned
	 about on some compilers.
	+ Maintenance work.
* [Multiprecision](/libs/multiprecision/):

	+ IMPORTANT: Mark C++03 support as deprecated and due for removal in
	 2021.
	+ Big update to cpp\_int adds faster Karatsuba and Coomba multiplication
	 routines.
	+ Fix conversion of gmp\_rational to `long
	double` and `\_\_float128`,
	 fixes #178.
	+ Fix up libtommath support to function with the latest libtom releases.
	+ Fix up some incompatibilities with the latest Intel C++ compiler.
	+ Fix up `constexpr` arithmetic
	 support for latest MSVC release.
* [Outcome](/libs/outcome/):

	+ Enhancements:
	 
		- Performance of Outcome-based code compiled by clang has been
		 greatly improved. The previous implementation of Outcome's
		 status bitfield confused clang's optimiser, which caused low
		 quality codegen. Unlike most codegen issues, this was noticeably
		 in empirical benchmarks of real world code, as was shown by
		 [P1886 **Error
		 speed benchmarking**](https://wg21.link/P1886).
		- The safe part of the [`better\_optimisation`](https://github.com/ned14/outcome/tree/better_optimisation)
		 Outcome v2.2.0 future branch was merged to Outcome v2.1.3 which
		 includes a new status bitfield implementation. This appears
		 to not confuse clang's optimiser, and clang 9 produces code
		 which routinely beats GCC 9's code for various canned use cases.
		- Installability is now CI tested per commit. Due to installability
		 of standalone Outcome (e.g. `make
		install`) breaking
		 itself rather more frequently than is ideal, installability
		 is now tested on CI per commit.
	+ Bug fixes:
	 
		- [#214](https://github.com/ned14/outcome/issues/214)
		 Newer Concepts implementing compilers were unhappy with the
		 early check for destructibility of `T`
		 and `E`, so removed
		 template constraints, falling back to static assert which runs
		 later in the type instantiation sequence.
		- [#220](https://github.com/ned14/outcome/issues/220)
		 A false positive undefined behaviour sanitiser failure in some
		 use cases of Experimental Outcome was worked around to avoid
		 the failure message.
* [PolyCollection](/libs/poly_collection/):

	+ Suppressed a potential redundant move warning in `boost::poly\_collection::for\_each`.
	+ Fixed a bug by which elements were copied rather than moved in allocator-extended
	 move construction and move assigment between collections with non-propagating,
	 unequal allocators.
	+ Allocator-extended move construction no longer decays to allocator-extended
	 copy construction for the legacy version of libstdc++-v3 shipped
	 with GCC 4.8 (which can also be used by Clang).
* [Stacktrace](/libs/stacktrace/):

	+ Added documentation on distribution of PDBs [#55](https://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/55), [#47](https://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/47) (thanks
	 to emptyVoid and Roger Orr for information and to zlojvavan for testing).
	+ Fixed msvc-9 build
	+ Maintenance work, including test fixes [#86](https://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/86), fixing typos
	 [#84](https://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/84), CI improvements and hardening, inspect tool fixes.
* [Test](/libs/test/):

	+ Boost.test v3.13 see the [Changes
	 log](/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/change_log.html) for more details.
	+ New feature: It is now possible to combine tolerance indication,
	 user message and collection comparison modifier in a single `BOOST\_TEST` expression. See change
	 logs for more details.

* [ThrowException](/libs/throw_exception/):

	+ Added an overload of `throw\_exception`
	 that takes a `boost::source\_location`
	 object.
	+ NOTE: Projects using `BOOST\_THROW\_EXCEPTION`
	 with exceptions disabled will need to add a definition of this new
	 overload.
* [TTI](/libs/tti/):

	+ Added introspection of function templates for more recent C++ compilers
	 versions from gcc and vc++. as well as all versions of clang. Older
	 versions of vc++ before 14.0 and gcc prior to 4.8 may fail.
	+ Added specific introspection for elements of struct/class, enum,
	 and union types, which can be used for more fine-grained introspection
	 than the general 'type' introspection.
* [TypeIndex](/libs/type_index/):

	+ Maintenance work, including CI integration with inspect tool.
* [Utility](/libs/utility/):

	+ The `ostream\_string`
	 facility has moved from the Utility library to the IO library as
	 `ostream\_put`.
* [Variant](/libs/variant/):

	+ Removed unused includes (thanks to Nikita Kniazev [#74](https://github.com/boostorg/variant/issues/74)).
	+ Fixed zero-as-null-pointer-constat warnings (thanks to Bart Siwek
	 [#77](https://github.com/boostorg/variant/issues/77)).
	+ Maintenance work, including typo fixes.
* [Variant2](/libs/variant2/):

	+ Added support for `std::hash`,
	 `boost::hash`.
	+ `variant<T...>`
	 is now trivial when all types in `T...` are trivial. This improves performance
	 by enabling it to be passed to, and returned from, functions in registers.
* [WinAPI](/libs/winapi/):

	+ Headers in `boost/detail/winapi`
	 are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
	+ Boost.WinAPI headers no longer include `winerror.h`.
	 Include `boost/winapi/error\_codes.hpp` to get Windows error codes.
	 ([#81](https://github.com/boostorg/winapi/issues/81))

### Updated Tools


* [Build](/tools/build/):

	+ Includes release [4.2.0](https://github.com/boostorg/build/releases/tag/4.2.0)
	 of B2.
	+ WARNING: Since version 4.0.0 B2 requires a capable C++11 compiler
