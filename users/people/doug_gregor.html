Doug Gregor
===========

![-](doug_gregor.jpg) Doug
 is a post-doctoral research fellow in the [Open Systems Lab](http://www.osl.iu.edu),
 part of the [Computer Science](http://www.cs.indiana.edu) department at [Indiana University,
 Bloomington.](http://www.iub.edu).


As a generic programming zealot, his search for the One True
 Generic Language has seen him through the trials of the
 [Generic Programming Group](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/research/gpg/), and [many](http://www.boost.org) [diversions](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/).


When not hunched over in front of an [XEmacs](http://www.xemacs.org) window,
 Doug looks to his wife Amy to help him navigate through the
 daylight. Once there, he enjoys tennis and the occasional game
 of paintball.
