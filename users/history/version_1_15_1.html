Version 1.15.1
==============

Version 1.15.1
--------------


June 21st, 2000 12:00 GMT


 Fixes to [cast.hpp](/boost/cast.hpp) and [operators](/libs/utility/operators.htm)
 fix. Minor additions to [config.hpp](/boost/config.hpp) for
 Microsoft compilers. The 1.15.0 operators changes seem to have introduced incompatibilities.
 We are working on fixing them, and have started to build a regression test to
 prevent similar future problems.
