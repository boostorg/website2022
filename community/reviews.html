Boost Formal Review Process



Boost Formal Review Process
===========================

Before Requesting a Formal Review
---------------------------------


**Read and follow the Boost [submission
 process](/development/submissions.html).** There are several steps a library author
 must take before a formal review is requested.

* [Introduction](#Introduction)
* [What to include in Review Comments](#Comments)
* [Results](#Results)
* [Notes for Review Managers](#Review_Manager)
* [Notes for Library Submitters](#Submitters)
* [Library Maintainer's Rights and
 Responsibilities](#Maintainer)
* [Review Wizard](#Wizard)
* [Fast Track Reviews](#Fast-Track)


Introduction
------------


Proposed libraries are accepted into Boost only after
 undergoing a formal review, where Boost mailing list members
 comment on their evaluation of the library.


The final "accept" or "reject" decision is made by the
 [Review Manager](#Review_Manager), based on the
 review comments received from boost mailing list members.


Boost mailing list members are encouraged to submit Formal
 Review comments:


* Publicly on the mailing list.
* Privately to the Review Manager.


Private comments to a library submitter may be helpful to
 her or him, but won't help the Review Manager reach a decision,
 so the other forms are preferred.


The review period will normally last for 10 days.


What to include in
 Review Comments
-----------------------------------


Your comments may be brief or lengthy, but the
 Review Manager needs your evaluation of the library. If you
 identify problems along the way, please note if they are minor,
 serious, or showstoppers.


The goal of a Boost library review is to improve the library
 through constructive criticism, and at the end a decision must
 be made: is the library good enough at this point to accept
 into Boost? If not, we hope to have provided enough
 constructive criticism for it to be improved and accepted at a
 later time. The Serialization library is a good example of how
 constructive criticism resulted in revisions resulting in an
 excellent library that was accepted in its second review.


Here are some questions you might want to answer in your
 review:


* What is your evaluation of the design?
* What is your evaluation of the implementation?
* What is your evaluation of the documentation?
* What is your evaluation of the potential usefulness of
 the library?
* Did you try to use the library? With what compiler? Did
 you have any problems?
* How much effort did you put into your evaluation? A
 glance? A quick reading? In-depth study?
* Are you knowledgeable about the problem domain?


And finally, every review should answer this question:


* Do you think the library should be accepted as a Boost
 library? Be sure to say this explicitly so that your other
 comments don't obscure your overall opinion.


Many reviews include questions for library authors. Authors
 are interested in defending their library against your
 criticisms; otherwise, they would not have brought their library
 up for review. If you don't get a response to your question
 quickly, be patient; if it takes too long or you don't get an
 answer you feel is sufficient, ask again or try to rephrase the
 question. Do remember that English is not the native language
 for many Boosters, and that can cause misunderstandings.


E-mail is a poor communication medium, and even if messages
 rarely get lost in transmission, they often get drowned in the
 deluge of other messages. Don't assume that an unanswered
 message means you're being ignored. Given constructively,
 criticism will be taken better and have more positive effects,
 and you'll get the answers you want.


Results
-------


Within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the comment
 period, the Review Manager will post a message to the mailing
 list saying if the library has been accepted or rejected. A
 rationale is also helpful, but its extent is up to the Review
 Manager. If there are suggestions, or conditions that must be
 met before final inclusion, they should be stated. Concerns
 about the timeliness or quality of the review report should be
 brought to the Review Wizards off-list.


Notes for
 Review Managers
--------------------------


Before a library can be scheduled for formal review, an
 active boost member not connected with the library submission
 must volunteer to be the "Review Manager" for the library.
 Members may contact a library author on- or off-list to express
 interest in managing the review. The library author has to accept
 a person as a review manager.


The Review Manager:


* Checks the submission to make sure it really is complete
 enough to warrant formal review. See the [Boost Library Requirements
 and Guidelines](/development/requirements.html). If necessary, work with the submitter to
 verify the code compiles and runs correctly on several
 compilers and platforms.
* Finalizes the schedule with the Review Wizard and the submitter.
* Posts a notice of the review schedule on both the regular
 **[boost mailing list](mailto:boost@lists.boost.org)** and the
 **[boost-announce](mailto:boost-announce@lists.boost.org) mailing list**.
	+ The notice should include a brief description of the
	 library and what it does, to let readers know if the
	 library is one they are interested in reviewing.
	+ If the library is known to fail with certain
	 compilers, please mention them in the review notice so
	 reviewers with those compilers won't waste time
	 diagnosing known problems.
	+ It is advised to send the notice to each mailing list
	 in a separate e-mail, otherwise online e-mail to news
	 gateways could get confused.
* Inspects the Boost [library catalogue](/doc/libs/release/libs/libraries.htm)
 for libraries which may interact with the new submission.
 These potential interactions should be pointed out in the
 review announcement, and the author(s) of these libraries
 should be privately notified and urged to participate in the
 review.
* Urges people to do reviews if they aren't forthcoming.
* Follows review discussions regarding the library,
 moderating or answering questions as needed.
* Asks the [review wizard](#Wizard) for
 permission to extend the review schedule if it appears that
 too few reviews will be submitted during the review period.
* Decides if there is consensus to accept the library and
 if there are any conditions attached. Consensus is not the
 same as a vote. The Review Manager has discretion to weigh
 opinions based on authority or thoughtfulness.
* Posts a notice of the [review
 results](#Results) on the regular **[boost](mailto:boost@lists.boost.org)** mailing
 list, the **[boost-users](mailto:boost-users@lists.boost.org)**
 mailing list, and the **[boost-announce](mailto:boost-announce@lists.boost.org)**
 mailing list.


In other words, it is the Review Manager's responsibility to
 make sure the review process works smoothly.


Although the review manager is also allowed to review the library,
 they are expected to serve the interests of the Boost users.
 Since the review manager may have a (strong) opinion about the library,
 it is recommended as a matter of principle they do not share their opinion
 until the very end of the review. Possibly, until the summary of reviews.
 The review manager will make the final choice and announcing an opinion early
 in the process could negatively affect the review process.


Notes for Library
 Submitters
-----------------------------


See [Submission
 Process](/development/submissions.html) for a description of the steps a library developer
 goes through to get a library accepted by Boost.


First, the library author should accept a review manager.
 If they feel, for whatever reason, a candidate for a review manager
 is not competent or fair, they should not accept such candidate.


A proposed library should remain stable during the review
 period; it will just confuse and irritate reviewers if there
 are numerous changes. It is, however, useful to upload fixes
 for serious bugs right away, particularly those which prevent
 reviewers from fully evaluating the library. Post a notice of
 such fixes on the mailing list.


Library improvements suggested by reviewers should normally
 be held until after the completion of review period. If the
 suggested changes might affect the reviewer's judgments, post a
 notice of the pending change on the mailing list.


Library
 Maintainer's Rights and Responsibilities
-------------------------------------------------


By submitting a library to boost, you accept responsibility
 for maintaining your library or finding a qualified volunteer
 to serve as maintainer. You must be willing to put your library
 and documentation under a Boost-compatible license.


You will be expected to respond to reasonable bug reports
 and questions on time and to participate as needed
 in discussions of your library on the boost mailing lists.


You are free to change your library in any way you wish, and
 you are encouraged to actively make improvements. However, peer
 review is an important part of the Boost process and as such
 you are also encouraged to get feedback from the boost
 community before making substantial changes to the interface of
 an accepted library.


If at some point you no longer wish to serve as maintainer
 of your library, it is your responsibility to make this known
 to the boost community and to find another individual to take
 your place.


Libraries which have been abandoned will be put in care of
 the [Community
 Maintenance Team](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/CommunityMaintenance).


Review Wizards
--------------


The Review Wizards coordinate the formal review
 schedule:


* When a formal review is requested for a library:
	+ Approve the review manager based on initial acceptance
	 by the library submitter, their participation in the Boost
	 community, including the mailing list, previous reviews,
	 and other forums.
	+ Suggest a schedule, after checking (via private
	 email) the availability of the review manager and library
	 author.
	+ Finalize the schedule, once the review manager
	 verifies the library is ready for review.
	+ Resolve schedule slips or other issues with review
	 managers and submitters.
* Maintains a schedule of both past and pending reviews, in
 the form of the [Review
 Schedule](review_schedule.html) web page.
* Resolves questions from review managers and library
 submitters, who sometimes want a third opinion on questions
 such as "Should we extend the review period because
 ...?"
* Monitors the general review process, and makes minor
 adjustments as needed, or queries the list about possible
 major adjustments.


The role of Boost Review Wizard is currently played by:


* Mateusz Loskot (mateusz at loskot dot net)
* John Phillips (johnphillipsithaca at gmail dot com)


Past Review Wizards (we thank you for your service):


* Ronald Garcia
* Tom Brinkman
* Thomas Witt


Fast Track
 Reviews
-------------------


To qualify for fast track review:


* The component must be small.
* The technique must be already in use in Boost libraries
 and the new component provides a common implementation.
* A full Boost-conformant implementation is available in
 the sandbox.
* The Review Wizard determines that the proposal qualifies
 for fast track review.


Procedure:


* The Boost Review Wizard posts a review announcement to
 the main Boost developer's list. The fast track review period will
 normally last for 5 days. No two fast-track reviews will run
 in parallel. Fast track reviews may run during full reviews,
 though generally, this is to be avoided.
* After the review period ends, the submitter will post a
 review summary containing proposed changes to the reviewed
 implementation.
* The Review Wizard will accept or reject the proposed
 library and proposed changes.
* After applying the proposed changes, the component is
 checked into the repository like any other library.


Mini-Reviews
------------


If a review results in conditions on acceptance, the review
 manager may request a Mini-Review to determine if the
 conditions have been met. The Mini-Review is usually conducted
 by the same review manager.
