 This is a bug fix release addressing many problems with the 1.34.0 release. It
 is a recommended upgrade for all users of Boost 1.34.0. For a complete list of
 fixes see [Boost
 Trac](http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/query?status=closed&milestone=Boost+1.34.1).
 
### Supported Compilers
 New in this release is improved support for the IBM XL C/C++ compiler.
 
 Boost is tested on a wide range of compilers and platforms. Since Boost libraries
 rely on modern C++ features not available in all compilers, not all Boost libraries
 will work with every compiler. New in this release The following compilers
 and platforms have been extensively tested with Boost, although many other
 compilers and platforms will work as well. For more information, see the [regression test results](https://www.boost.org/regression/release/user/).
 


* [Apple GCC](http://developer.apple.com/) 4.0.1 on Mac
 OS X.
* [Borland C++](http://www.codegear.com/products/cppbuilder)
 5.8.2 on Windows.
* [GNU C++](http://gcc.gnu.org/)

	+ 3.2.x., 3.3.x, 3.4.x, 4.0.x, 4.1.x on Linux
	+ 4.1.x on Solaris
	+ 3.4.x on Windows
* [HP C++ for Tru64 UNIX 7.1](http://h30097.www3.hp.com/cplus/).
* [HP aC++ A.06.14](http://www.hp.com/go/c++).
* [Intel
 C++](http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/compilers/index.htm) 9.1 on Windows, 9.0 on Linux.
* [Metrowerks CodeWarrior](http://www.metrowerks.com/)
 9.4 on Windows.
* [Microsoft Visual C++](http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/)
 6.0 (sp5, with and without STLport), 7.0, 7.1, 8.0. Note: Boost does not
 support the non-standard "Safe" C++ Library shipping with Visual
 C++ 8.0, which may result in many spurious warnings from Boost headers
 and other standards-conforming C++ code. To suppress these warnings, define
 the macro `\_SCL\_SECURE\_NO\_DEPRECATE`.
* [Sun Studio 11](http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/index.jsp)
 on Solaris.
