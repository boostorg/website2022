	+ [Why are not all links
	 underlined?](#faq-links-3)


Why are links
 "underlined"? The website follows some simple design
 principles to make the site as widely accessible as practical.
 The style for links within document text are underlined to have
 a non-color, clear, visual indicator that it is a link.
 Underlines provide the most familiar indicator to people
 because of the historical default usage by web browsers.


Why are not
 "standard" underlines used for links? The use of the
 bottom border provides for considerable more flexibility in
 style than the underline font style. It is important to have
 such freedom to be able to indicate the various states links
 can be in. In the case of the Boost design the bottom border
 underline is used to represent the difference between internal
 vs. external links, and between visited and unvisited links.
 All of which are orthogonal to the text being a link.


Why are not all
 links underlined? When it is clear from the context that
 the text is a link the underline is ommited to reduce visual
 clutter, as this is also within a context under which the text
 is already a collection of links. For such situations the
 design uses a link box context. All such links are placed
 within a light grey bordered box to indicate that the items
 within it are links.
