===========

![-](darin_adler.jpg) Darin
 Adler has been programming computers since 1976. He loves to do
 it.


His first major professional experience was at [Apple Computer](http://apple.com). In 1988
 he led the team that rewrote the Macintosh Finder in C++.
 Before that project was completed, he was shanghaied to be the
 technical lead for the System 7 project (these days they would
 call it "Mac OS 7"). The group he formed to help him do that,
 the Blue Meanies, is still a [legend](http://www.cupertino.de/pages/archiv/EasterEggs/BlueMeanies.html) in the Apple community.


Since Apple, Darin has worked at [General
 Magic](http://www.generalmagic.com) as an architect of the [Magic Cap](http://www.google.com/search?q=Magic+Cap) OS, used the moniker [Bent Spoon Software](http://bentspoon.com)
 to do consulting, and helped start Eazel, a company that worked
 to make Linux easier to use and developed the Nautilus
 graphical shell for [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org). Since 1997, he has worked from his home
 in Los Angeles, CA, collaborating with clients and coworkers in
 other locations.


He prefers to use and program Macintosh computers with C++.
 But work on the GNOME project is best accomplished with a
 non-Macintosh PC. (That's why Darin is sitting in front of two
 computers.) The other people working on the GNOME project don't
 like C++, so he's writing a lot of C code these days.


The picture shows him hard at work with his C++ guru, his
 daughter Sophia.


He has hobbies and stuff but you don't want to read about
 that here.


You can contact him by sending mail to [darin@bentspoon.com](mailto:darin@bentspoon.com).
