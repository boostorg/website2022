Joaquín M López Muñoz
=====================

![-](joaquin_lopez.jpg)
 Joaquín is a telecom engineer from the [Polytechnic University of
 Madrid](http://www.upm.es). He currently works as an independent consultant in
 a number of technological companies and startups.
 Though actual programming is not one
 of his job responsibilities, he still does some C++ for fun
 when nobody's around.


Joaquín's professional career began with his first
 exposure to a Dragon 32 (a Tandy TRS-80 clone) at the age of
 13, though at the time he probably was unaware of the future
 impact of this event. He enjoys Mathematics, Logic and Latin;
 his lower case interests include paper folding, compulsive
 reading, writing, traveling and visiting all sorts of pubs
 and restaurants.
