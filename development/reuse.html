Boost Library Reuse



Boost Library reuse: cost versus benefit trade-offs
===================================================

A Boost library **should not** use libraries
 other than Boost or the C++ Standard Library.


A Boost library **should** use other Boost
 Libraries or the C++ Standard Library, but only when the
 benefits outweigh the costs.


The benefits of using components from other libraries may
 include clearer, more understandable code, reduced development
 and maintenance costs, and the assurance which comes from
 reusing well-known and trusted building blocks.


The costs may include undesirable coupling between
 components, and added compilation and runtime costs. If the
 interface to the additional component is complex, using it may
 make code less readable, and thus actually increase development
 and maintenance costs.


Negative effects of coupling become obvious when one library
 uses a second library which uses a third, and so on. The worst
 form of coupling requires the user understand each of the
 coupled libraries. Coupling may also reduce the portability of
 a library - even in case when all used libraries are
 self-sufficient (see example of questionable usage of
 <iostream> library below).


**Example where another boost component should
 certainly be used:** boost::noncopyable (in [boost/utility.hpp](/doc/libs/release/boost/utility.hpp))
 has considerable benefits; it simplifies code, improves
 readability, and signals intent. Costs are low as coupling is
 limited; noncopyable itself uses no other classes and its
 header includes only the lightweight headers
 <boost/config.hpp> and <cstddef>. There are no
 runtime costs at all. With costs so low and benefits so high,
 other boost libraries should use boost::noncopyable when the
 need arises except in exceptional circumstances.


**Example where a standard library component might
 possibly be used:** Providing diagnostic output as a
 debugging aid can be a nice feature for a library. Yet using
 Standard Library <iostream> can involve a lot of
 additional cost, particularly if <iostream> is unlikely
 to be used elsewhere in the application. In certain GUI or
 embedded applications, coupling to <iostream> would be a
 disqualification. Consider redesign of the boost library in
 question so that the user supplies the diagnostic output
 mechanism.


**Example where another boost component should not be
 used:** The boost dir\_it library has considerable
 coupling and runtime costs, not to mention portability issues
 for unsupported operating systems. While completely appropriate
 when directory iteration is required, it would not be
 reasonable for another boost library to use dir\_it just to
 check that a file is available before opening. C++ Standard
 Library file open functionality does this at lower cost. Don't
 use dir\_it just for the sake of using a boost library.
