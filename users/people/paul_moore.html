Paul Moore
==========

![-](paul_moore.jpg) Paul
 Moore lives in Cheshire, England. He is married, with one son.
 His "day job" is as an Oracle DBA, but he writes C and C++
 programs in his spare time.


Paul started programming on Acorn's BBC Micro and RISC PC
 series of computers, but finally went mainstream and bought a
 PC, on which he now runs Windows and Linux. Paul's main
 interest is in porting and developing open-source software, and
 so his main programming language is C (at least until the open
 source community switches to C++).


Paul's main claim to C++ fame is that he owns all 3 editions
 of Bjarne Stroustrup's "The C++ Programming language", plus the
 ARM and the C++ standard, but he didn't own a C++ compiler
 until after the 3rd edition of Stroustrup's book came out. Make
 of that what you will...
