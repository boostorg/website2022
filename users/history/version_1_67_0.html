### Third Party Downloads


* [Windows Binaries](https://boostorg.jfrog.io/artifactory/main/release/1.67.0/binaries/)


### Known Issues
 These are patches from library authors which were found too late to be fixed
 in the release. Be careful as they have not been through the normal testing
 process.
 


* Fix compiling with FreeBSD:
 
	+ </patches/1_67_0/0001-Fiber-Use-pthread_setaffinity_np-on-FreeBSD-as-well.patch>
	+ </patches/1_67_0/0002-Wave-Avoid-using-wrong-T_DIVIDE-on-BSDs.patch>
* Fix Python auto-linking:
 
	+ </patches/1_67_0/0003-Python-Fix-auto-linking-logic-Windows-only.patch>

### New Libraries


* [Contract](/libs/contract/):
 Contract programming
 for C++. All contract programming features are supported: Subcontracting,
 class invariants, postconditions (with old and return values), preconditions,
 customizable actions on assertion failure (e.g., terminate or throw), optional
 compilation and checking of assertions, etc, from Lorenzo Caminiti.
* [HOF](/libs/hof/):
 Higher-order functions for C++,
 from Paul Fultz II.

### Updated Libraries


* [Asio](/libs/asio/):

	+ Added missing const qualifier to `basic\_socket\_acceptor::get\_option`.
	+ Worked around a parsing error that occurs with some versions of gcc.
	+ Fixed broken code samples in tutorial.
	+ Added new experimental features. (Note that "experimental"
	 features may be changed without notice in subsequent releases.)
	 
		- Added `experimental::detached`
		 completion token.
		- Added `experimental::redirect\_error`
		 completion token.
		- Added `experimental::co\_spawn`
		 facility for integration with the coroutines technical specification.
		- Updated timeout examples to use latest features.
		- Used `asio::steady\_timer` rather than
		 `asio::deadline\_timer`.
		- Used `asio::dynamic\_buffer` rather than
		 `asio::streambuf`.
		- Used timed `asio::io\_context::run\_for()` function for blocking clients.
		- Added example showing a custom completion token for blocking
		 with timeouts.
	+ Fixed unit tests to compile when `BOOST\_ASIO\_NO\_DEPRECATED`
	 is defined.
	+ Changed socket iostreams to use chrono by default, to fix compatibility
	 with the Networking TS. Define `BOOST\_ASIO\_USE\_BOOST\_DATE\_TIME\_FOR\_SOCKET\_IOSTREAM`
	 to enable the old Boost.Date\_Time interface in `basic\_socket\_streambuf`
	 and `basic\_socket\_iostream`.
	+ Updated examples to use chrono rather than Boost.Date\_Time.
	+ Fixed an incorrect member function detector in the `is\_dynamic\_buffer` trait.
	+ Fixed an `async\_result`
	 incompatibility with deprecated `handler\_type`.
	+ Added a missing move optimisation in the SSL stream implementation.
	+ Fixed incorrect `basic\_resolver\_results::value\_type`
	 typedef.
	+ Fixed a compile error with some OpenSSL versions when `SSL\_OP\_NO\_COMPRESSION` is defined.
	+ Changed `add\_certificate\_authority`
	 to process multiple certificates in a bundle.
	+ Eliminated deprecation warning with MSVC by using `std::invoke\_result`
	 rather than `std::result\_of`.
	+ Changed to use `std::string\_view`
	 for C++17 or later, and `std::experimental::string\_view`
	 for C++14. Define the preprocessor macro `BOOST\_ASIO\_DISABLE\_STD\_STRING\_VIEW`
	 to force the use of std::experimental::string\_view (assuming it is
	 available) when compiling in C++17 mode.
	+ Ensured `DynamicBuffer`
	 template arguments are decayed before using in `enable\_if`
	 tests.
	+ Changed documentation to distinguish legacy completion handlers (which
	 are still required to be CopyConstructible) from new MoveConstructible
	 handlers.
	+ Suppressed a discarded return value warning in the buffer debugging
	 support.
	+ Fixed `basic\_yield\_context`
	 to work with completion signatures containing reference parameters.
	+ Ensured that stackful coroutines launched using `spawn()` correctly store decayed copies
	 of their function and handler arguments.
	+ Fixed some compatibility issues with Android.
	+ Added cross-compilation support to Jamfiles.
	+ Fixed some minor portability issues in examples.
* [Atomic](/libs/atomic/):

	+ **Breaking change:** Changed the result
	 of the `(op)\_and\_test`
	 operations added in Boost 1.66 to the opposite - the functions now
	 return `true` if the operation
	 result is non-zero. This is consistent with other `test`
	 methods in Boost.Atomic and the C++ standard library. Users can define
	 `BOOST\_ATOMIC\_DETAIL\_HIGHLIGHT\_OP\_AND\_TEST`
	 when compiling their code to emit warnings on every use of the changed
	 functions. This way users can locate the code that needs to be updated.
	 ([#11](https://github.com/boostorg/atomic/issues/11))
	+ Update for C++2a. On C++11 compilers that support scoped enums, the
	 `memory\_order` enumeration
	 is now scoped and contains constants with shorter names like `acquire`, `release`
	 or `seq\_cst` (i.e.
	 users can use `memory\_order::acquire`
	 instead of `memory\_order\_acquire`).
	 The old constants are also provided for backward compatibility. ([P0439R0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0439r0.html))
	+ Update for C++2a. Added experimental support for atomic operations
	 on floating point types. In addition to general operations, `add`, `sub`,
	 `negate` operations
	 and their `fetch\_(op)` and `opaque\_(op)` versions are supported. Lock-free
	 property can be tested with the new macros `BOOST\_ATOMIC\_FLOAT/DOUBLE/LONG\_DOUBLE\_LOCK\_FREE`.
	 The support for floating point types is optional and can be disabled
	 by defining `BOOST\_ATOMIC\_NO\_FLOATING\_POINT`.
	 ([P0020R6](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0020r6.html))
	+ Added new experimental operations:
	 
		- `negate\_and\_test`
		 and `complement\_and\_test`
		 which perform negation or bitwise complement and return `true` if the result is not zero.
		- `add`, `sub`, `negate`,
		 `bitwise\_and`,
		 `bitwise\_or`,
		 `bitwise\_xor`,
		 `bitwise\_complement`
		 operations which perform the operation and return its result.
	+ For generic `atomic<T>` specialization, the default constructor
	 is now trivial if `T`'s
	 default constructor is.
	+ The internal implementation of `atomic<T>` has been updated to avoid undefined
	 behavior that stems from signed integer overflows. As required by
	 the C++ standard, the library uses two's complement representation
	 of signed integers internally and accroding rules of overflow. Currently,
	 the library requires the native signed integer types to also use
	 two's complement representation (but no defined overflow semantics).
	+ Improved Clang support. In particular, fixed DCAS not being lock-free
	 and fixed possible incorrect code generated on 32-bit x86.
	+ Improved MinGW support. For gcc versions up to 4.6, fixed compilation
	 of DCAS on x86.
	+ In x86 PIE code, asm blocks now preserve `ebx`
	 value.
* [Beast](/libs/beast/):

	+ This version fixes significant defects in `websocket::stream`
	 which can lead to asserts or undefined behavior. Users are encouraged
	 to update to the latest Boost release.
	+ For a complete list of changes, please view the official [Release
	 Notes](/libs/beast/doc/html/beast/release_notes.html).
* [ContainerHash](/libs/container_hash/):

	+ Extracted from the functional module to break a dependency cycle.
	+ Moved headers to new location to reflect name change, the old include
	 paths will still work.
	+ Added support for `std::string\_view`,
	 `std::error\_code`, `std::error\_condition`,
	 `std::optional`, `std::variant`,
	 `std::monostate` where available.
	+ Added explicit support for `vector<bool>`, so that it will work with libc++
	 ([#13501](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/13501)).
	+ More detail in the [library
	 change log](/doc/html/hash/changes.html#hash.changes.boost_1_67_0).
* [Context](/libs/context/):

	+ [#62](https://github.com/boostorg/context/issues/62)/[PR#64](https://github.com/boostorg/context/pull/64): fix i386/macho routines to correctly
	 return transfer\_t in EAX/EDX

* [Core](/libs/core/):

	+ Updated `to\_address`
	 and `pointer\_traits`
	 to reflect the design adopted for C++2a in [P0653R2](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0653r2.html)
	 (Glen Fernandes).

* [DLL](/libs/dll/):

	+ Fixes for calling functions on dirty `GetLastError()` [#16](https://github.com/boostorg/dll/issues/16).
* [Fiber](/libs/fiber/):

	+ [#128](https://github.com/boostorg/fiber/issues/128): Assertion "! ctx->ready\_is\_linked()" when
	 using condition\_variable::wait\_for
	+ [#132](https://github.com/boostorg/fiber/issues/132): fatal error: 'stdexception' file not found

	 were used before main() ([PR#62](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/pull/62), [PR#43](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/pull/43), [PR#50](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/pull/50),
	 [PR#59](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/pull/59))
* [Fusion](/libs/fusion/):

	 that this changes no behaviour from previous release, but compliant
	 to TypeTraits's change. ([PR#171](https://github.com/boostorg/fusion/pull/171))
* [Geometry](/libs/geometry/):

	+ Improvements:
	 
		- New map projection and SRS transformation representations (undocumented
		 for now due to potential interface changes).
		- New densify() algorithm.
		- No longer using std::iterator (thanks to Daniela Engert).
		- No longer using allocator directly in the rtree. Replaced with
		 boost::container::allocator\_traits (thanks to Daniela Engert).
		- Default rtree allocator changed to boost::container::new\_allocator
		 to still support move semantics emulation in C++03 with boost::container::allocator\_traits.
		- Area strategies interface changed. This is potentially a breaking
		 change.
		- Radius or Sphere can be passed into spherical strategies.
		- Added Point-Box and Box-Box spherical and geographic distance()
		 strategies.
		- Simplify (multi)polygons will discard output rings of 2 points
		 or (for closed polygons) 3 points, but it tries to avoid creating
		 those
		- Simplify (multi)polygons will omit empty interior rings or
		 polygons from output
	+ Solved issues:
	 
		- [13386](https://svn.boost.org/trac10/ticket/13386)
		 Workaround for some gcc compilers
		- [13381](https://svn.boost.org/trac10/ticket/13381)
		 Compile error with matrix\_transformer in Visual C++ 2015
		- [13436](https://svn.boost.org/trac10/ticket/13436)
		 Incorrectness in boost::geometry::model::polygon documentation
	+ Bugfixes:
	 
		- Add missing strategy resolving in length() algorithm, affecting
		 Variant support.
		- Simplify (multi)polygons now simplifies closing point
	+ Changes in behavior
	 
		- Simplify (multi)polygons now usually rotates input rings before
		 simplifying to select a non collinear point on its convex hull.
		 This improves output.
* [Locale](/libs/locale/):

	+ Added support of `unique\_ptr`
	 interface in addition to C++2003 `auto\_ptr`
	 - in order to support C++2017, now you can use `BOOST\_LOCALE\_HIDE\_AUTO\_PTR`
	 definiton to remove `auto\_ptr`
	 from the interfaces and prevent deprecated watnings.
	+ Fixed test problem with ICU >60.1
	+ Fix of solaris build
	+ Fixed wired FreeBSD/clang issue on optimized build. Probably compiler
	 workaround
	+ Added workaround for failing MSVC tests due to 932 codepage codecvt
	 issue
	+ Fixed bugs 6851, 12572, 12453
	+ Fixed missing throw in case of failure in `icu/date\_time`
	+ Fixed build agains Boost.Thread v4
	+ Fixed Year of week instead of year ICU backend formatting
	+ Fixed formatting test for ICU 56.1 and above
* [Log](/libs/log/):

	+ Improved compatibility with C++17: use `allocator\_traits`
	 to work with allocators instead of directly accessing its members.
	+ Improved compatibility with gcc 7 and later by updating library ABI
	 namespace definition.
	+ Added documentation for the "Append" config file parameter
	 for "TextFile" sinks. The parameter was supported previously,
	 only the documentation was missing.
* [Math](/libs/math/index.html):

	+ Add naive Monte Carlo integration support.
	+ Add Chebyshev interpolation routines.
* [Multi-index Containers](/libs/multi_index/index.html):

	+ Elements with overloaded `operator&` are now fully accepted (ticket
	 [#13307](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/13307)). Thanks to Daniel Frey for his updating [Boost.Operators](/libs/utility/operators.htm#deref)
	 to help fix this issue.
	+ Avoided usage of `std::allocator`
	 members deprecated in C++17. Contributed by Daniela Engert.
	+ Maintenance fixes.
* [Multiprecision](/libs/multiprecision/index.html):

	+ **Breaking Change:** When converting
	 a multiprecision integer to a narrower type, if the value is too
	 large (or negative) to fit in the smaller type, then the result is
	 either the maximum (or minimum) value of the target type. This was
	 always the intended behaviour, but was somewhat haphazardly enforced
	 before. If you really do want just the low order N bits of a value,
	 then you will need to mask these out prior to the case, for example:
	 `static\_cast<unsigned>(~static\_cast<unsigned>(0) & my\_value)`. Note that technically (to avoid
	 undefined behaviour) you should do the same thing with built in integer
	 types too. See [#13109](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/13109).
	+ Fix bug in conversion of decimal to rational types (zero needs special
	 handling), see [#13148](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/13148).
	+ Fix conversion from cpp\_bin\_float to a wider built in integer type,
	 see [#13301](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/13301).
	+ Improve performance heurists used in cpp\_bin\_float exp function.
	+ Fix bug in floor/ceil and cpp\_bin\_float when the exponent type is
	 wider than an int, see [#13264](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/13264).
	+ Disable explicit conversion operator when the target type is already
	 constructible from this type, see [#30](https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues/30).
	+ Fix support for changes new to MPIR-3.0, see [#13124](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/13124).
* [Optional](/libs/optional/index.html):

	+ Fixed issue [#46](https://github.com/boostorg/optional/issues/46)
	+ Fixed `-Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant`
	 warnings.
* [Phoenix](/libs/phoenix/):

	+ Correct documentation and example code. ([#8187](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/8187), [PR#56](https://github.com/boostorg/phoenix/pull/56),
	 [PR#57](https://github.com/boostorg/phoenix/pull/57))
	+ Fixed bug with initializing phoenix lazy from array types in C++11.
	 ([#12733](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/12733), [PR#58](https://github.com/boostorg/phoenix/pull/58), [PR#61](https://github.com/boostorg/phoenix/pull/61))
	+ Use proto subscript and assignment overload operators buildins to
	 fix compile error with some lambda experssions on recent MSVC. ([#62](https://github.com/boostorg/phoenix/issues/62),
	 [PR#64](https://github.com/boostorg/phoenix/pull/64), [PR#66](https://github.com/boostorg/phoenix/pull/66), [PR#67](https://github.com/boostorg/phoenix/pull/67))
	+ Remove use of deprecated `std::iteratror`.
	 Thanks to Daniela Engert. ([PR#59](https://github.com/boostorg/phoenix/pull/59))
* [PolyCollection](/libs/poly_collection/):

	+ Maintenance fixes.
* [Python](/libs/python/):

	+ The library name now includes the version suffix of the Python version
	 used to compile it. For example, a variant compiled with Python 2.7
	 will produce library names `boost\_python27`
	 and `boost\_numpy27`,
	 etc.. Combined with a related fix in Boost.Build, this means that
	 it is now possible to build variants for multiple Python versions
	 in a single build process.
* [Spirit](/libs/spirit/):

	+ Spirit.X3:
	 
		- **Breaking change:** Removed
		 `with\_context`
		 ([#239](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/issues/239))
		- Added noexcept to `x3::variant`
		 and `forward\_ast`
		 ([#241](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/issues/241))
		- CR+LF lines wrongly counted in `error\_handler::position()` ([#248](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/issues/248))
		- Fixed `unused\_type`
		 attribute case in `parse\_into\_container`
		 ([#266](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/issues/266))
		- Fixed parsing into associative containers ([#289](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/issues/289))
		- Fixed overflow problem in `uint\_parser<signed
		T>`
		 ([#297](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/issues/297))

* [Stacktrace](/libs/stacktrace/):

	+ Async safe dumping into files on Windows OS was causing hangs on
	 some platforms and now is disabled [#33](https://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/33). Users are encouraged
	 to update to the latest Boost release.
	+ [ContainerHash](/libs/container_hash/) library
	 is now used to reduce dependencies.
	+ Minor fixes (including [#31](https://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/31), [#38](https://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/38), [#39](https://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/39),
	 [#40](https://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/40), [#42](https://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/42)).
* [Test](/libs/test/):

	+ Boost.test v3.7 see the [Changes
	 log](/doc/libs/1_67_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/change_log.html) for more details.
	+ Breaking changes
	 
		- Adding test cases with the same name to the same test suite
		 is now reported as an error. See the changes log for more details.
	+ New feature:
	 
		- Colour output on by default and available on Windows,
		- Improved and clearer command line help
		- `BOOST\_AUTO\_TEST\_CASE\_TEMPLATE`
		 now accepts a sequence of types in an `std::tuple`

* [TypeIndex](/libs/type_index/):

	+ [ContainerHash](/libs/container_hash/) library
	 is now used to reduce dependencies.
	+ Minor fixes (including [#17](https://github.com/boostorg/type_index/issues/17))
* [TypeTraits](/libs/type_traits/):

	+ Added new traits `detected`,
	 `detected\_or`, `is\_detected`, `is\_detected\_convertible`,
	 `is\_detected\_exact`,
	 `is\_complete`.
	+ Added greatly improved code for detecting binary operators.
	+ Add assertions for completeness to traits which require complete
	 types as arguments: this prevents various traits from giving eroneous
	 results from incomplete types.
	+ Fix minor issue with mpl compatibility, see [#12212](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/12212).
	+ Add macro to indicate when `is\_constructible`
	 is fully implemented, see [#12003](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/12003).
	+ Update `is\_function`
	 and `is\_member\_function\_pointer`
	 to work correctly with C++17 noexcept specifications.
	+ Add workaround for `is\_default\_constructible`
	 and `std::pair`.
	+ Added fallback for `is\_nothrow\_swappable`
	 on pre-C++11 compilers.
* [Utility](/libs/utility/):

	+ **Breaking change:** `<boost/utility.hpp>`
	 header no longer includes `boost::next`
	 and `boost::prior` as they have been moved to
	 the iterator module. Instead include `<boost/next\_prior.hpp>`.
	 Other uses of `<boost/utility.hpp>` are discouraged, it's better
	 to use the header for the specific functionality instead.
* [Unordered](/libs/unordered/):

	+ Template deduction guides.
	+ Standard conforming `noexcept`
	 specifications for `swap`,
	 `operator=`
	 and node handles.
	+ Add `element\_type`
	 to iterators, so that `std::pointer\_traits`
	 will work.
	+ Support `std::piecewise\_construct` on recent Visual
	 C++ and Dinkumware libraries.
	+ Use `std::iterator\_traits` rather than the
	 boost iterator traits in order to remove dependency on Boost.Iterator.
	+ Iterators no longer inherit from `std::iterator`,
	 as it's deprecated ([PR#7](https://github.com/boostorg/unordered/pull/7)).
	+ More detail in the [library
	 change log](/doc/html/unordered/changes.html#unordered.changes.boost_1_67_0).
* [Units](/libs/units/):

	+ Fix sqrt for scaled units [#10270](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10270) [#27](https://github.com/boostorg/units/issues/27)
	+ Add constexpr support [#22](https://github.com/boostorg/units/issues/22)
	+ minor documentation fixes
* [Uuid](/libs/uuid/):

	+ **Breaking change:** random\_generator
	 is no longer copyable ([#61](https://github.com/boostorg/uuid/issues/61))
	+ Optimized random\_generator to use OS-provided entropy directly ([PR#53](https://github.com/boostorg/uuid/pull/53))
	+ Provide `random\_generator\_mt19937`
	 for bulk UUID generation
	+ Handle entropy acquisition errors instead of ignoring them
	+ Support for Windows UWP ([#24](https://github.com/boostorg/uuid/issues/24))
	+ Support for CloudABI
* [Variant](/libs/variant/):

	+ Substitute function arguments on compilers with variadic templates
	 support and do not generate substitution metafunctions using preprocessor
	 [#42](https://github.com/boostorg/variant/issues/42), [#46](https://github.com/boostorg/variant/issues/46). Many thanks to Nikita Kniazev for providing
	 an initial fix.
	+ Perfect forwarding for passing visitor in apply\_visitor [#40](https://github.com/boostorg/variant/issues/40),
	 [#13288](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/13288). Many thanks to Paweł Dac!
	+ Minor fixes (including [#41](https://github.com/boostorg/variant/issues/41), [#44](https://github.com/boostorg/variant/issues/44))
