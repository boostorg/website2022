![-](mark_rodgers.jpg) Mark
 Rodgers lives in [Wellington](http://www.wellington.govt.nz/), the capital of New Zealand,
 with his wife, Clare, and their son, Ronnie.


He studied Computer Science at [Victoria University of Wellington](http://www.vuw.ac.nz/home/default.aspx) from 1983 to
 1986, completing a B.Sc. (Hons). He now works as
 consultant through his company, Cadenza New Zealand Ltd, and
 also markets Cadenza Drawing Board™, a CAD system he
 developed.


Mark has been programming in C++ since about 1990, and loves
 every minute of it, but is continually amazed at how much more
 he still has to learn.
