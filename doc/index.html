Documentation
=============

Much work goes into the documentation for the Boost
 libraries and tools. The documentation included in the library
 and tool release is also available here:


Additional information about the testing and release practices,
 infrastructure and in progress developments is available on
 our [Trac wiki](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/).


Translations
------------


Boost doesn't have the resources to translate the
 documentation itself, but there is at least one separate group
 translating the documentation. If you have formed another, tell
 us on the [documentation list](/community/groups.html#boostdocs) and
 we'll add a link.
