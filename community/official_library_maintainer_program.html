Boost Library Official Maintainer Program
=========================================


Introduction
------------


The [Boost Community Maintenance Team](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/CommunityMaintenance) (CMT) has identified many Boost 
 libraries still used but not maintained actively. To protect the
 reputation that Boost has cultivated over the years, as an
 organization that provides high-quality open-source software,
 all libraries bundled with Boost releases
 have active and engaged maintainers. The purpose of the Boost
 Library Official Maintainer Program is to recruit companies and 
 organizations, that are likely already providing internal support, 
 to become official maintainers of those libraries already important
 to them. 


In exchange for taking on maintenance of a library, Boost will 
 display the maintainer's logo below in the [Libraries and Participants](#libraries_and_participants)
 section. Boost may also display the logo on the Boost github 
 and Trac sites. Maintainers are also allowed to use the [Boost Official Library
 Maintainer Logo](blom_libraries/logos/blom_logo.png) on their own sites, presentations,
 etc...


Applying to the Program
-----------------------


If you're interested in maintaining a Boost library :


1. Read the [Memorandum of
 Understanding](blom_libraries/BLOM_MoU_v0.pdf), which outlines what's expected of
 mainainers as well as terms for leaving the program.
2. Send an email to the program administrator ([Alex Olivas](mailto:olivas@icecube.umd.edu)) indicating
 which library (or libraries) you'd like to maintain.


Thanks for helping out!
