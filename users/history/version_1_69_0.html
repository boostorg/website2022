### Notes for non-Windows
 users
 The Boost build system now supports visibilities. If you are building shared
 libraries, they will use hidden visibility by default. As a result Boost shared
 libraries become smaller, load faster and have less chances to get a symbol
 collision.
 
 See [Boost.Build
 visibility and local-visibility](/build/manual/develop/index.html#bbv2.builtin.features.visibility) for more info.
 
 To disable that feature you can use use a command line `./b2 visibility=global` to
 build.

	 chat example](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/master/libs/beast/doc/html/beast/examples.html#beast.examples.cppcon_2018) and [presentation
	 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FQwAjELMek).

	 Notes](/libs/beast/doc/html/beast/release_notes.html).

	+ Fixed crashes in `boost::filesystem::copy`
	 due to undefined behavior in the implementation. ([PR#71](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/pull/71))

		- Drop own FP routines in favor of `boost::math`
		 ([#392](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/issues/392)) ([#13531](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/13531))
		- Missing visibility mark on exception types ([#409](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/issues/409))
		- to\_utf8: Fixed wchar\_t handling on Windows ([#413](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/issues/413))
		 ([#395](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/issues/395))
	+ Spirit V2
	 
		- Drop own FP routines in favor of `boost::math`
		 ([#392](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/issues/392)) ([#13531](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/13531))
		- Missing visibility mark on exception types ([#409](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/issues/409))
		- Fixed transform\_attribute ambiguity ([#407](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/issues/407)) ([#396](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/issues/396))
		- to\_utf8: Fixed wchar\_t handling on Windows ([#413](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/issues/413))
		 ([#395](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/issues/395))
	+ Spirit.Classic:
	 
		- Missing visibility mark on exception types ([#409](https://github.com/boostorg/spirit/issues/409))
* [Stacktrace](/libs/stacktrace/):

	+ `libbacktrace` usage
	 was significantly improved. `BOOST\_STACKTRACE\_USE\_BACKTRACE`
	 or `boost\_stacktrace\_backtrace`
	 users are encouraged to update:
	 
		- Memory consumprion dropped down.
		- Stack capturing became faster by an order of magnitude.
		- `syminfo` fallback
		 enabled to provide information for visible symbols even without
		 debug information (thanks to github user driesdeschout!)[#60](https://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/60),
		 [#61](https://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/61).
		- Exact location of the `backtrace.h`
		 header now can be specified via `BOOST\_STACKTRACE\_BACKTRACE\_INCLUDE\_FILE`,
		 to allow `backtrace.h`
		 header usage on platforms and compilers where that header is
		 unreachable otherwise (for example Ubuntu Xenial + Clang) [#59](https://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/59).
	+ Optimized stack capturing if `max\_depth`
	 is set (thanks to Jan Eisenhauer for the PR!) [#67](https://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/67).
	+ Added `to\_string(const stacktrace& )`
	 functions for fast conversion of stacktraces to `std::string`
	[#57](https://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/57).
	+ Maintenance: updated docs [#62](https://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/62), tests updated.
* [System](/libs/system/):

	+ Boost.System is now header-only. A stub library is still built for
	 compatibility, but linking to it is no longer necessary.
	+ Even more functions have been marked `constexpr`.
	+ The destructor of `error\_category`
	 is now `protected` and
	 no longer `virtual`. This
	 is a potentially breaking change, but its impact is expected to be
	 limited.
	+ `error\_category` now
	 has a constructor that accepts a 64 bit identifier, enabling distinct
	 category objects to compare equal.
	+ The constructors of `error\_category`
	 are now `protected`.
	+ A non-allocating, nonthrowing overload of `message`
	 has been added.
	+ A virtual function `failed`
	 has been added, allowing categories for which success is not synonymous
	 with 0.
	+ The deprecated `boost::system::throws`
	 object has been removed.
	+ `boost::throws()`
	 is now deprecated and its use is discouraged.
	+ The constructor of `system\_error`
	 taking a single `error\_code`
	 argument is now `explicit`.
	+ `system\_error::code()`
	 now returns by value.
* [Test](/libs/test/):

	+ Boost.test v3.9 see the [Changes
	 log](libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/change_log.html) for more details.
	+ New feature:
	 
		- Official support of header-only variant of Boost.Test with
		 multiple translation units.
		- Now possible to manually add a test case by specifying its
		 name, with `BOOST\_TEST\_CASE\_NAME`
		- Better support of `boost::exception`
		 in the logs
	+ Bug fixes and pull requests:
	 
		- Trac tickets: [#13380](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/13380), [#13625](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/13625), [#13637](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/13637)
		- GitHub Issues: [#149](https://github.com/boostorg/test/issues/149), [#150](https://github.com/boostorg/test/issues/150), [#156](https://github.com/boostorg/test/issues/156), [#158](https://github.com/boostorg/test/issues/158),
		 [#163](https://github.com/boostorg/test/issues/163)
		- GitHub Pull Requests: [PR#147](https://github.com/boostorg/test/pull/147), [PR#148](https://github.com/boostorg/test/pull/148), [PR#151](https://github.com/boostorg/test/pull/151),
		 [PR#154](https://github.com/boostorg/test/pull/154), [PR#161](https://github.com/boostorg/test/pull/161)
* [TypeIndex](/libs/type_index/):

	+ Fix the regression and speed up parsing of the `boost/type\_traits.hpp`
	 header by 30% (thanks to Nikita Kniazev for the PR!) [#21](https://github.com/boostorg/type_index/issues/21).
* [Utility](/libs/utility/):

	+ Added support for non-inheritable empty types to `boost::compressed\_pair`
	 by avoiding the empty base optimization for types which are declared
	 as final (Glen Fernandes).
* [Variant](/libs/variant/):

	+ Fixed issue with visibility. Now `boost::bad\_visit`
	 exception could cross the boundaries of shared library with hidden
	 visibility and could be catched in other shared library with hidden
	 visibility.
* [YAP](/libs/yap/):

	+ Minor changes to support MSVC++ version 14.15 (Visual Studio 2017
	 version 15.8).
	+ Doc fixes.

### Discontinued Libraries


* Signals (v1) is now removed. Its removal was announced in 1.68 and its
 deprecation was announced in 1.54. Boost 1.68 is the last release that
 provides this library. Users are encouraged to use Signals2 instead. The
 Boost community thanks Douglas Gregor for his work on Signals which served
