Boost C++ Libraries



IMC Summer of Code 2016
=======================

[![IMC](../gfx/imc.png)](http://www.imc.com/)
Boost has participated in the Google Summer of Code program
 for a decade and is very grateful for Google's generous past
 support. This program allows college students to have a paid
 summer internship working on open source projects, giving them
 an interesting alternative to summer onsite internships.
 Because the students that work on Boost libraries tend to stay
 with the same libraries summer after summer, the continuity of
 this program is important to Boost and to the students that
 work on Boost projects.


Boost has traditionally been a model GSoC participant
 receiving a more than average slot allocation, so we were
 caught by surprise when Google rejected our 2016 application.
 They asked us to apply again next year but to sit out 2016 to give open-source projects which don't normally get awarded
 an opportunity. We understand this rationale, but this policy
 would mean no summer internships for Boost and leave students
 that have been working on Boost libraries looking for other
 alternatives for the summer of 2016.


When [IMC Financial Markets](http://www.imc.com/)
 learned about this situation, they saw it as an opportunity to
 support the Boost community and demonstrate their commitment to
 student development and open source.


IMC worked with Boost to create its own "Boost Summer of
 Code" program, deliberately patterned after Google's program.
 IMC also stepped up to underwrite all the costs of this program
 for the summer of 2016.


We thank IMC for their support and community leadership.
