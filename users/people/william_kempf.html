 Bill Kempf lives in Omaha, NE with his wife Bonnie, his cat
 Dexter and his two Chinchillas, Chimney and Minuet. He married
 on Oct. 30, 1999 where he and his wife held a Halloween costume
 reception. If that doesn't give you an idea of what kind of guy
 he is, nothing will.


Bill graduated from Doane, a small private college in
 Nebraska in 1992 with a B.S. in Computer Science/Math. Being in
 the wrong place at the wrong time he had to take a job as the
 only person in an IS shop for a local affiliate of the Bunge
 Grain Company. In 1995 he moved on to a job as a software
 engineer for First Data Resources where he worked on
 client/server financial applications.
