Boost Background Information



Boost Background Information
============================

Why should an organization use Boost?
-------------------------------------


In a word, *Productivity*. Use of high-quality
 libraries like Boost speeds initial development, results in
 fewer bugs, reduces reinvention-of-the-wheel, and cuts
 long-term maintenance costs. And since Boost libraries tend to
 become de facto or de jure standards, many programmers are
 already familiar with them.


Ten of the Boost libraries are included in the [C++ Standard Library's TR1](http://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/library_technical_report.html), and so are
 slated for later full standardization. More Boost libraries are
 in the pipeline for [TR2](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2005/n1810.html). Using Boost libraries gives an
 organization a head-start in adopting new technologies.


Many organization already use programs implemented with
 Boost, like Adobe [Acrobat Reader 7.0](http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html).


Who else is using Boost?
------------------------


See the [Who's Using Boost
 page](/users/uses.html) for a sampling. We don't know the exact numbers, but a
 release gets around 100,000 downloads from SourceForge, and
 that is only one of several distribution routes.


What do others say about Boost?

How do users get support?
-------------------------


For relatively straightforward support needs, users rely on
 the [mailing lists](/community/groups.html). One of
 the advantages of Boost is the responsiveness of other users
 and Boost developers.


What about license issues?
--------------------------


Boost has its own [license](license.html),
 developed with help from the Harvard Law School. The [Boost license polices](license.html) encourage both
 commercial and non-commercial use, and the Boost license is not
 related to the GPL or other licenses - that are sometimes seen
 as business unfriendly.


What about other intellectual property issues?
----------------------------------------------


The Boost libraries tend to be new, fresh, and creative
 designs. They are not copies, clones, or derivations of
 proprietary libraries. Boost has a firm policy to respect the
 IP rights of others. The development of Boost libraries is
 publicly documented via the mailing lists and version control
 repository. The source code has been inspected by many, many
 knowledgeable programmers. Each Boost file has a copyright
 notice and license information. IP issues have been reviewed by
 the legal teams from some of the corporations which use Boost,
 and in some cases these lawyers have been kind enough to give
 Boost feedback on IP issues. There are no guarantees, but those
 factors all tend to reduce IP risk.


Why would anyone give away valuable software for free?
------------------------------------------------------


Businesses and other organizations often prefer to have code
 developed, maintained, and improved in the open source
 community when it does not contain technology specific to their
 application domain, because it allows them to focus more
 development resources on their core business.


Individuals contribute for the technical challenge, to hone
 their technical skills, for the sense of community, as part of
 their graduate school programs, as a way around geographic
 isolation, to enhance their employment opportunities, and as
 advertisements for their consulting services. There are
 probably as many reasons as there are individuals. Some of the
 apparently individual contributions come from employees of
 support companies with contracts from businesses or other
 organizations who have an interest in seeing that a library is
 well-maintained.


Who pays Boost's expenses?
--------------------------


Boost doesn't really have any expenses! All the
 infrastructure is contributed by supporters, such as the
 [Open Systems
 Lab](http://www.osl.iu.edu/) at Indiana University, [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/),
 [Boost Consulting](http://www.boost-consulting.com/), [MetaCommunications](http://www.meta-comm.com/), and the individuals,
 companies, and other organizations who run the regression
 tests. Borland, HP, Intel, and Microsoft have contributed
 compilers. And hundreds, or even thousands, of programmers
 contribute their time. That's what makes Boost possible.
