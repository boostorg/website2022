Open Source Boost



Open Source Boost
=================

Boost is used in a variety of Open Source Projects, both
 applications and libraries. Indeed many Open Source libraries
 developed around Boost have in the past been judged of high
 enough quality to be absorbed into the main Boost source tree,
 a process that will no doubt continue into the future. Others
 are in highly specialized niche markets, ranging from
 probability theory to astronomy, via mass spectroscopy:
 whatever your field of interest you'll find something of value
 in Boost.


Algocoders
----------


Algocoders
 has been using boost since last 6+ years with a mission to help people
 build a better software eco-system by standing on the shoulder of giants.
 


 
 If it wasn't for Boost, then it could have been really difficult for us
 to build our framework based on sound mathematical foundation of computer science
 using modern C++.

 It is the pioneering efforts at Boost towards
 "Using and Extending C++11, Boost and Beyond"
 which has motivated us to devote ourself in developing bullet-size capsules
 in the form of tiny booklets with industrial-set framework to lift the thin veil
 with initial focus on practical usage of C++11
 vis-a-vis mathematical foundation behind it.
 
 Enthused by boost, we are working tirelessly towards publishing a series of
 books (or booklets)
 which will bridge the gap between esoteric and street-side ones.
 Initial focus will be on C++11, Boost, Loki, STL, Algorithms, Data Structures,
 Multi-threading, Design Patterns, gcc, Clang, valgrind.
 
 First book in this series is Foundation of Algorithms in C++11, Volume 1:
 Using and Extending C++11, Boost and Beyond (published December 2012)
 
 List of books in progress:
 


* Smart Pointers : Tips and Techniques in C++ : Using and Extending C++11, Boost and Beyond
* C++11 FAQs : Using and Extending C++11, Boost and Beyond
* Concepts & Traits C++ : Using and Extending C++11, Boost and Beyond
 We use almost all the libraries in Boost including trunk and branches,
 especially Spirit, Phoenix, Proto, MPL, Fusion.
 


Adobe Software Libraries
------------------------


The [Adobe Software Libraries](http://opensource.adobe.com/)
 provide components for modeling the human interface appearance
 and behavior in a software application. The Adobe Software
 Libraries depend on many parts of Boost including [Boost.Any](../doc/libs/release/libs/any/index.html),
 [Boost.Bind](../doc/libs/release/libs/bind/index.html),
 [Boost.Function](../doc/libs/release/libs/function/index.html),
 [Boost.MPL](../doc/libs/release/libs/mpl/index.html),
 [Boost.Operators](../doc/libs/release/libs/utility/operators.htm),
 [Boost.Range](../doc/libs/release/libs/range/index.html),
 [Boost.StaticAssert](../doc/libs/release/libs/static_assert/index.html),
 [Boost.Thread](../doc/libs/release/libs/thread/index.html),
 and [Boost.TypeTraits](../doc/libs/release/libs/type_traits/index.html).


Currently Boost and the Adobe Software Libraries are in use
 in around 30 Adobe products.


LyX Document Editor
-------------------


[The LyX
 Document Editor](http://www.lyx.org/) is an advanced open source document
 processor that encourages an approach to writing based on the
 structure of your documents, not their appearance. LyX produces
 high quality, professional output, using LaTeX, an industrial
 strength typesetting engine.


LyX uses many parts of Boost, including [Array](../doc/libs/release/libs/array/index.html), [Boost.Bind](../doc/libs/release/libs/bind/index.html),
 [Boost.Regex](../doc/libs/release/libs/regex/index.html),
 [Boost.TypeTraits](../doc/libs/release/libs/type_traits/index.html),
 [Boost.Function](../doc/libs/release/libs/function/index.html),
 and [Boost.Signals](../doc/libs/release/libs/signals/index.html).


CodeSynthesis XML Schema to C++ Data Binding Compiler (XSD)
 by Code Synthesis Tools CC
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[CodeSynthesis XML
 Schema to C++ Data Binding Compiler (XSD)](http://codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/) is an
 open-source, cross-platform XML Data Binding implementation for
 C++. Provided with an XML instance specification (XML Schema),
 it generates C++ classes that represent the given vocabulary as
 well as parsing and serialization code. You can then access the
 data stored in XML using types and functions that semantically
 correspond to your application domain rather than dealing with
 elements, attributes, and text in a direct representation of
 XML such as DOM or SAX.


XSD uses [Boost.Regex](../doc/libs/release/libs/regex/index.html) and
 [Boost.FileSystem](../doc/libs/release/libs/filesystem/index.html)
 libraries from Boost. [Boost.Regex](../doc/libs/release/libs/regex/index.html) is
 used to perform transformations on file, type and member names.
 [Boost.FileSystem](../doc/libs/release/libs/filesystem/index.html)
 is used to capture and manipulate XML Schema include and import
 paths. Additionally, we are planning to provide an optional
 mapping of XML Schema date and time types to C++ types from the
 Boost [Boost.DateTime](../doc/libs/release/libs/date_time/index.html)
 library.


CodeShop
--------


I am happy to announce Amsterdam based [CodeShop](http://www.code-shop.com) has been using
 Boost since 2005 on all of it's projects (and CodeShop memebers
 have been using Boost since 2001).


We used it on the following:


*OpenZoep*


An open source voip stack
 (xmpp-sip*rtp*(port)audio/codecs), capable of pc2pc
 calls and pc2pstn calls - it's a message based sdk, so you
 could write your own Gtalk or Skype ...


Boost is used everywhere: from the xmpp implementation
 ([Boost.Function](../doc/libs/release/libs/function/index.html),
 [Boost.Asio](../doc/libs/release/libs/asio/index.html)) to
 the codecs-wrapper ([Boost.SmartPointers](../doc/libs/release/libs/smart_ptr/index.html))
 - and more. Boost made the code a lot easier, more fun, safer
 and faster to develop. Bjam was used as build system.


See [description](http://www.code-shop.com/2007/1/14/openzoep)
 and [trac&svn](https://open.code-shop.com/trac/openzoep).


*Abonja / Whitelabelvideo*


Online videosharing platform: you can upload and watch
 flashvideo online, but at the same time run your pc client and
 download all your preferences automatically for viewing later
 at home


Boost and C++ are used for the serverside tooling. Bjam is
 used as build system.


[www.abonja.nl](http://www.abonja.nl) and [www.whitelabelvideo.nl](http://www.whitelabelvideo.nl)
 (Dutch only: a javascript sdk for viewing and uploading - Boost
 is used serverside also).


Code from above and other projects made available as plain
 download or as library.


Pieces address 'simple' problems like a windows registry
 wrapper to more system like parts as for instance a drm
 implementation. Boost is used all over (\_\_filesystem, [Boost.Thread](../doc/libs/release/libs/thread/index.html),
 [Boost.Asio](../doc/libs/release/libs/asio/index.html),
 [Boost.Spirit](../doc/libs/release/libs/spirit/index.html)
 etc); [Boost.Build](../build/)
 is used as build system.

*"All complex data structures in Hydranode are
 implemented using [Boost.MultiIndex](../doc/libs/release/libs/multi_index/index.html)
 containers, which significantly reduced development time and
 kept code clean. Format is being used for all text formatting.
 Having [Boost.Thread](../doc/libs/release/libs/thread/index.html)
