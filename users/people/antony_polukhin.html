===============

![-](antony_polukhin.jpg)Antony Polukhin is a software developer.


That's it.


Well, if we go to his website [apolukhin.github.io](https://apolukhin.github.io/) we would notice that he represents
 Russia in ISO WG21 C++. We would also note that he has authored many Boost
 libraries and maintains even more.


He also works for Yandex.Taxi Ltd., helps Russian speaking people with
 C++ standardization proposals, continues to contribute to the open source
 and to the C++ language in general.


Looks like he also authored a bunch of books and articles, gave quite a lot of talks in different languages but mostly on the same programming language.


Oh, he also does consulting on C++. It's on the web site!


He is married, with two children.
