In House Boost



In House Boost
==============

Whether you're a government department, an internet startup,
 or a specialist consultancy, in-house developement using the
 Boost Libraries can significantly shorten your development
 cycles.


Cern
----


[The Large Hadron Collider](http://lhc.web.cern.ch/lhc/)
 experiments at CERN make use of the Boost C++ libraries.
 The experiment's C++ programs have several millions of
 lines of code for the detector simulation, data reconstruction and
 data analysis and use several of the components of the Boost library.
 Examples of Boost libraries used are Any, Spirit, Date Time, Program Options, Regex, SmartPtr, Thread.


Google
------


[google-gtags](http://code.google.com/p/google-gtags/)
 Provides server-based tags serving for large codebases. This is
 an extension to GNU Emacs and X-Emacs TAGS functionality, that
 uses [Boost.Test](../doc/libs/release/libs/test/index.html) as
 its unit test framework.


LiquidNet
---------


[LiquidNet](http://www.liquidnet.com/) is Americas number
 one electronic marketplace for large block trading, and the 5th
 fastest growing company according to Inc Magazine.

Océ-Technologies B.V.
---------------------


Throughout the world [Océ](http://www.oce.com) is one of the major

 related services. We develop, manufacture, service and sell
 printers, scanners, peripheral equipment and media, supported
 by unique software. Océ products for the corporate and
 commercial market are widely known for their quality, ease of
 use, speed and reliability.


The Boost libraries enable us to get a higher degree of
 uniformity and quality in our code. During a redesign last year
 we found that lots of small constructions from Boost shortens
 development time and prevents having to reinvent many wheels.

Rational Discovery LLC
----------------------


[Rational Discovery](http://www.rationaldiscovery.com)
 provides computational modeling, combinatorial library design
 and custom software development services to the pharmaceutical,
 biotech and chemical industries.


*"We do a substantial amount of internal research to
 develop new approaches for applying machine-learning techniques
 to solve chemical problems. Because we're a small organization
 and chemistry is a large and complex field, it is essential
 that we be able to quickly and easily prototype and test new
 algorithms. We have found the Boost libraries, a reliable
 source of high-quality code, to be indispensable.*
