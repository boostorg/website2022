Boost has moved downloads to JFrog Artifactory


 



Boost has moved downloads to JFrog Artifactory
==============================================

Boost has moved downloads to JFrog Artifactory
----------------------------------------------


April 29th, 2021 18:00 GMT


 The service that Boost uses to serve up its releases, Bintray.com is being retired
 by JFrog on the 1st of May. Fortunately for Boost, they have a new service, called
 JFrog.Arifactory, which we have transitioned to.
 
 For the users of Boost, the only difference is that there is a new URL to download
 releases and snapshots.
 
 Instead of: <https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/>
 you should use <https://boostorg.jfrog.io/artifactory/main/release/>
 to retrieve boost releases.
 
 Note: The pre-1.64 Boost releases are still available via Sourceforge.
 
 Thank you to JFrog for all your past and current support.
