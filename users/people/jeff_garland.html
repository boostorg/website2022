Jeff Garland
============

![-](jeff_garland.jpg) Jeff
 Garland a software developer/consultant from sunny Phoenix,
 Arizona USA (that's always UTC-7 since there's no DST in AZ).
 He is the author of the [boost date-time
 library](/doc/libs/release/doc/html/date_time.html) as well as a book on [representing software architecture](http://www.largescalesoftwarearchitecture.com).


Jeff has been distracted from finishing all those cool
 features people want in date-time by running the [Boost Wiki](http://www.crystalclearsoftware.com/cgi-bin/boost_wiki/wiki.pl), serving as a review manager,
 and a [Boost
 Moderator](/community/moderators.html).


On the rare day that he's not in front of a computer from
 morning till night you might find him out hiking, biking, or
 skiing in Arizona's mountains and canyons with his wife and 2
 daughters.
