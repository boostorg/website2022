Boost Test Policies and Protocols



Boost Test Policies and Protocols
=================================

The Boost libraries are intended to be both reliable and
 portable. Every experienced programmer knows that means each
 library must be tested against a suitable number of test cases,
 on a wide range of platforms, and then tested again (regression
 tested) every time a change is made and before every
 release.


"Quality assurance based on a wide range of targeted tests"
 as one of the key answers to C.A.R Hoare's question "How did
 software get so reliable without proof."


Regression test
---------------


Boost uses an automatic [regression
 test suite](/doc/tools/regression/index.html) which generates HTML [compiler status
 tables](/development/testing.html#RegressionTesting).


Test Policy
-----------


### Required


* Every Boost library should supply one or more suitable
 test programs to be exercised by the Boost [regression
 test suite](/doc/tools/regression/index.html). In addition to the usual compile-link-run
 tests expecting successful completion, compile-only or
 compile-and-link-only tests may be performed, and success for
 the test may be defined as failure of the steps.
* Test program execution must report errors by returning a
 non-zero value. They may also write to stdout or stderr, but
 that output should be relatively brief. Regardless of other
 output, a non-zero return value is the only way the
 regression test framework will recognize an error has
 occurred. Note that test programs to be included in the
 status tables must compile, link, and run quickly since the
 tests are executed many, many, times.
* Libraries with time consuming tests should be divided
 into a fast-execution basic test program for the status
 tables, and a separate full-coverage test program for
 exhaustive test cases. The basic test should concentrate on
 compilation issues so that the status tables accurately
 reflect the library's likelihood of correct compilation on a
 platform.
* If for any reason the usual test policies do not apply to
 a particular library, an alternate test strategy must be
 implemented.
* A [Jamfile](/doc/tools/regression/index.html#Adding_new_test) to drive the regression tests for the
 library.


### Optional (but highly recommended)


The [Boost
 Test Library](/doc/libs/release/libs/test/index.html) provides many useful components which ease the
 construction of test programs.


* Use the library's [Test Tools](/doc/libs/release/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/testing_tools.html) for the construction of simple test programs
 that do not need much structure.
* Use the library's [Unit
 Test Framework](/doc/libs/release/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/tests_organization.html) for the construction of more complex test
 programs that need to be structured into individual tests and
 test suites.


Suggested Protocol for Fixing Bugs or Adding Features.
------------------------------------------------------


* First, add regression test cases that detects the bug or
 tests the feature. Sometimes adding one case suggests similar
 untested cases, and they are added too.
* Second, for bugs, run the regression test and verify that
 the bug is now detected.
* Third, then, and only then, fix the bug or add the
 feature.
* Finally, rerun the full regression tests - sometimes the
 change breaks something else.
