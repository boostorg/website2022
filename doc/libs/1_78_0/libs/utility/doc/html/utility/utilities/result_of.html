#### 
[Introduction](result_of.html#utility.utilities.result_of.introduction "Introduction")
 The class template [`result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")
 helps determine the type of a call expression. For example, given an lvalue
 `f` of type `F` and lvalues `t1`,`t2`, ..., `tN`
 of types `T1`, `T2`, ..., `TN`,
 respectively, the type [`result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")`<F(T1,
T2,
..., TN)>::type`
 defines the result type of the expression `f(t1,
t2,
...,tN)`.
 
 This implementation permits the type `F`
 to be a function pointer, function reference, member function pointer,
 or class type. By default, N may be any value between 0 and 16. To change
 the upper limit, define the macro `BOOST\_RESULT\_OF\_NUM\_ARGS`
 to the maximum value for N. Class template [`result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") resides in the header
 [`<boost/utility/result\_of.hpp>`](../../../../../../boost/utility/result_of.hpp).
 
 If your compiler's support for [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype) is adequate, [`result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") automatically uses it
 to deduce the type of the call expression, in which case [`result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")`<F(T1, T2, ..., TN)>::type` names the type [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype)`(boost::declval<F>()(boost::declval<T1>(), boost::declval<T2>(), ..., boost::declval<TN>()))`, as in the following example.
 
```
struct functor {
    template<class T>
    T operator()(T x)
    {
        return x;
    }
};

typedef [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")<functor(int)>::type type; // type is int

```


 You can test whether [`result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")
 is using [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype) by checking if the macro
 `BOOST\_RESULT\_OF\_USE\_DECLTYPE`
 is defined after including `result\_of.hpp`.
 You can also force [`result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")
 to use [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype) by defining `BOOST\_RESULT\_OF\_USE\_DECLTYPE` prior to
 including `result\_of.hpp`.
 
 If [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype) is not used, then automatic
 result type deduction of function objects is not possible. Instead, [`result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")
 uses the following protocol to allow the programmer to specify a type.
 When `F` is a class type
 with a member type `result\_type`,
 `result\_of<F(T1, T2, ..., TN)>::type` is `F::result\_type`.
 When `F` does not contain
 `result\_type`, `result\_of<F(T1, T2, ..., TN)>::type` is `F::result<F(T1,
T2,
..., TN)>::type`
 when `N >
0` or `void`
 when `N =
0`.
 
 Note that it is the responsibility of the programmer to ensure that function
 objects accurately advertise their result type via this protocol, as in
 the following example.
 
```
struct functor {
    template <class> struct result;

    template<class F, class T>
    struct result<F(T)> {
        typedef T type;
    };

    template<class T>
    T operator()(T x)
    {
        return x;
    }
};

typedef [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")<functor(int)>::type type; // type is int

```


 Since [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype) is a language feature standardized
 in C++11, if you are writing a function object to be used with [`result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of"), for maximum portability,
 you might consider following the above protocol even if your compiler has
 proper [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype) support.
 
 If you wish to continue to use the protocol on compilers that support
 [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype), there are two options:
 


* You can use [`boost::tr1\_result\_of`](../../boost/tr1_result_of.html "Struct template tr1_result_of"),
 which is also defined in [`<boost/utility/result\_of.hpp>`](../../../../../boost/utility/result_of.hpp).
* Alternatively, you can define the macro `BOOST\_RESULT\_OF\_USE\_TR1`,
 which causes [`result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")
 to use the protocol described above instead of [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype). If you choose to follow
 the protocol, take care to ensure that the `result\_type`
 and `result<>`
 members accurately represent the return type of `operator()` given a call expression.


 Additionally, [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")
 provides a third mode of operation, which some users may find convenient.
 When `BOOST\_RESULT\_OF\_USE\_TR1\_WITH\_DECLTYPE\_FALLBACK`
 is defined, [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")
 behaves as follows. If the function object has a member type `result\_type` or member template `result<>`,
 then [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")
 will use the TR1 protocol.
 
 Otherwise, [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")
 will use [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype). Using TR1 with a [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype) fallback may workaround
 certain problems at the cost of portability. For example:
 


* Deficient compiler: If your code requires [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") to work with incomplete
 return types but your compiler's [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype) implementation does
 not support incomplete return types, then you can use the TR1 protocol
 as a workaround. Support for incomplete return types was added late
 in the C++11 standardization process (see [N3276](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3276.pdf))
 and is not implemented by some compilers.
* Deficient legacy code: If your existing TR1 function object advertises
 a different type than the actual result type deduced by [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype), then using TR1 with
 a [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype) fallback will allow
 you to work with both your existing TR1 function objects and new C++11
 function object. This situation could occur if your legacy function
 objects misused the TR1 protocol. See the documentation on known [differences](result_of.html#sec:result_of_tr1_diff) between [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") and TR1.
* This implementation of [`result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") requires class template
 partial specialization, the ability to parse function types properly,
 and support for SFINAE. If [`result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") is not supported
 by your compiler, including the header [`<boost/utility/result\_of.hpp>`](../../../../../boost/utility/result_of.hpp) will define the macro
 `BOOST\_NO\_RESULT\_OF`.


 For additional information about [`result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of"), see the C++ Library
 Technical Report, [N1836](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2005/n1836.pdf),
 or, for motivation and design rationale, the [`result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") [proposal](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2003/n1454.html).
 

#### 
Usage guidelines for [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")
 The following are general suggestions about when and how to use [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of").
 


1. If you are targeting C++11 and are not concerned about portability
 to non-compliant compilers or previous versions of the standard, then
 use `[`std::result\_of`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/result_of)`. If `[`std::result\_of`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/result_of)` meets your
 needs, then there's no reason to stop using it.
2. If you are targeting C++11 but may port your code to legacy compilers
 at some time in the future, then use [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") with [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype). When [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype) is used [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") and `[`std::result\_of`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/result_of)` are usually
 interchangeable. See the documentation on known [differences](result_of.html#sec:result_of_cxx11_diff)
 between [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")
 and C++11 [`std::result\_of`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/result_of).
3. If compiler portability is required, use [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") with the TR1 protocol


 Regardless of how you configure [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of"), it is important to
 bear in mind that the return type of a function may change depending on
 its arguments, and additionally, the return type of a member function may
 change depending on the cv-qualification of the object. [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") must be passed the appropriately
 cv-qualified types in order to deduce the corresponding return type.
 
 For example:
 
```
struct functor {
    int& operator()(int);
    int const& operator()(int) const;

    float& operator()(float&);
    float const& operator()(float const&);
};

typedef [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")<
    functor(int)
>::type type1; // type1 is int &

typedef [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")<
    const functor(int)
>::type type2; // type2 is int const &

typedef [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")<
    functor(float&)
>::type type3; // type3 is float &

typedef [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")<
    functor(float const&)
>::type type4; // type4 is float const &

```
#### 
[Usage
 guidelines for the TR1 result\_of protocol](result_of.html#utility.utilities.result_of.usage_guidelines_for_the_tr1_res "Usage guidelines for the TR1 result_of protocol")
 On compliant C++11 compilers, [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") can use [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype) to deduce the type of any
 call expression, including calls to function objects. However, on pre-C++11
 compilers or on compilers without adequate decltype support, additional
 scaffolding is needed from function objects as described above. The following
 are suggestions about how to use the TR1 protocol.
 


* When the return type does not depend on the argument types or the cv-qualification
 of the function object, simply define `result\_type`.
 There is no need to use the `result`
 template unless the return type varies.</li>
* Use the protocol specified type when defining function prototypes.
 This can help ensure the actual return type does not get out of sync
 with the protocol specification. For example:


```
struct functor {
    typedef int result\_type;
    result\_type operator()(int);
};

```

* Always specify the `result`
 specialization near the corresponding `operator()` overload. This can make it easier
 to keep the specializations in sync with the overloads. For example:


```
struct functor {
    template<class> struct result;

    template<class F>
    struct result<F(int)> {
        typedef int& type;
    };
    result<functor(int)>::type operator()(int);

    template<class F>
    struct result<const F(int)> {
        typedef int const& type;
    };
    result<const functor(int)>::type operator()(int) const;
};

```

* Use type transformations to simplify the `result`
 template specialization. For example, the following uses [Boost.TypeTraits](../../../type_traits/doc/html/index.html)
 to specialize the `result`
 template for a single `operator()` that can be called on both a const
 and non-const function object with either an lvalue or rvalue argument.


```
struct functor {
    template<class> struct result;

    template<class F, class T>
    struct result<F(T)>
        : boost::remove\_cv<
              typename boost::remove\_reference<T>::type
          >
    {};

    template<class T>
    T operator()(T const&amp; x) const;
};

```
#### 
Known differences between [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")
 and [`boost::tr1\_result\_of`](../../boost/tr1_result_of.html "Struct template tr1_result_of")
 When using [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype), [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") ignores the TR1 protocol
 and instead deduces the return type of function objects directly via [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype). In most situations, users
 will not notice a difference, so long as they use the protocol correctly.
 The following are situations in which the type deduced by [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") is known to differ depending
 on whether [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype) or the TR1 protocol is
 used.
 
 TR1 protocol misusage: When using the TR1 protocol, [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") cannot detect whether
 the actual type of a call to a function object is the same as the type
 specified by the protocol, which allows for the possibility of inadvertent
 mismatches between the specified type and the actual type. When using
 [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype), these subtle bugs may
 result in compilation errors. For example:
 
```
struct functor {
   typedef short result\_type;
   int operator()(short);
};

#ifdef BOOST\_RESULT\_OF\_USE\_DECLTYPE

BOOST\_STATIC\_ASSERT((
   boost::is\_same<[`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")<functor(short)>::type, int>::value
));

#else

BOOST\_STATIC\_ASSERT((
   boost::is\_same<[`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")<functor(short)>::type, short>::value
));

#endif

```


 Note that the user can force [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") to use the TR1 protocol
 even on platforms that support [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype) by defining `BOOST\_RESULT\_OF\_USE\_TR1`.
 
 Nullary function objects: When using the TR1 protocol, [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") cannot always deduce
 the type of calls to nullary function objects, in which case the type defaults
 to void. When using [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype), [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") always gives the actual
 type of the call expression. For example:
 
```
struct functor {
   template<class> struct result {
       typedef int type;
   };
   int operator()();
};

#ifdef BOOST\_RESULT\_OF\_USE\_DECLTYPE

BOOST\_STATIC\_ASSERT((
   boost::is\_same<[`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")<functor()>::type, int>::value
));

#else

BOOST\_STATIC\_ASSERT((
   boost::is\_same<[`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")<functor()>::type, void>::value
));

#endif

```


 Note that there are some workarounds for the nullary function problem.
 So long as the return type does not vary, `result\_type`
 can always be used to specify the return type regardless of arity. If the
 return type does vary, then the user can specialize [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") itself for nullary calls.
 
 Non-class prvalues and cv-qualification: When using the TR1 protocol,
 [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")
 will report the cv-qualified type specified by `result\_type`
 or the `result` template
 regardless of the actual cv-qualification of the call expression. When
 using [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype), [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") will report the actual
 type of the call expression, which is not cv-qualified when the expression
 is a non-class prvalue. For example:
 
```
struct functor {
   template<class> struct result;
   template<class F, class T> struct result<F(const T)> {
       typedef const T type;
   };

   const short operator()(const short);
   int const & operator()(int const &);
};

// Non-prvalue call expressions work the same with or without decltype.

BOOST\_STATIC\_ASSERT((
   boost::is\_same<
       [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")<functor(int const &)>::type,
       int const &
::value
));

// Non-class prvalue call expressions are not actually cv-qualified,
// but only the decltype-based result\_of reports this accurately.

#ifdef BOOST\_RESULT\_OF\_USE\_DECLTYPE

BOOST\_STATIC\_ASSERT((
   boost::is\_same<
       [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")<functor(const short)>::type,
       short
::value
));

#else

BOOST\_STATIC\_ASSERT((
   boost::is\_same<
       [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")<functor(const short)>::type,
       const short
::value
));

#endif

```
#### 
Known differences between
 [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")
 and C++11 result\_of
 When using [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype), [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of") implements most of the
 C++11 [`std::result\_of`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/result_of) specification. One
 known exception is that [`boost::result\_of`](../../boost/result_of.html "Struct template result_of")
 does not implement the requirements regarding pointers to member data.
