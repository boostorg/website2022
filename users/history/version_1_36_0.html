### New Libraries


* [Accumulators](/libs/accumulators/index.html): Framework
 for incremental calculation, and collection of statistical accumulators,
 from Eric Niebler.
* [Exception](/libs/exception/doc/boost-exception.html):
 A
 library for transporting of arbitrary data in exception objects, and transporting
 of exceptions between threads, from Emil Dotchevski.
* [Units](/libs/units/index.html):
 Zero-overhead
 dimensional analysis and unit/quantity manipulation and conversion, from
 Matthias Schabel and Steven Watanabe
* [Unordered](/libs/unordered/index.html):
 Unordered
 associative containers, from Daniel James.

### Updated Libraries


* [Asio](/libs/asio/index.html):

	+ Added support for serial ports.
	+ Added support for UNIX domain sockets.
	+ Added support for raw sockets and ICMP.
	+ Added wrappers for POSIX stream-oriented file descriptors (excluding
	 regular files).
	+ Added wrappers for Windows stream-oriented `HANDLE`s
	 such as named pipes (requires `HANDLE`s
	 that work with I/O completion ports).
	+ Added wrappers for Windows random-access `HANDLE`s
	 such as files (requires `HANDLE`s
	 that work with I/O completion ports).
	+ Added support for reactor-style operations (i.e. they report readiness
	 but perform no I/O) using a new `null\_buffers`
	 type.
	+ Added an iterator type for bytewise traversal of buffer sequences.
	+ Added new `read\_until()` and `async\_read\_until()` overloads that take a user-defined
	 function object for locating message boundaries.
	+ Added an experimental two-lock queue (enabled by defining `BOOST\_ASIO\_ENABLE\_TWO\_LOCK\_QUEUE`)
	 that may provide better `io\_service`
	 scalability across many processors.
	+ Various fixes, performance improvements, and more complete coverage
	 of the custom memory allocation support.
* [Assign](/libs/assign/index.html):
`list\_of()`
 (and its variants) now has overloaded comparison operators. This allows
 you to write test code such as `BOOST\_CHECK\_EQUAL( my\_container, list\_of(2)(3)(4)(5)
);`.
* [Circular Buffer](/libs/circular_buffer/index.html):

	+ Default constructor now doesn't allocate memory, and sets the capacity
	 of the buffer to 0
* [Foreach](/libs/foreach/index.html): `BOOST\_FOREACH` macro for easily iterating
 over the elements of a sequence, from Eric Niebler.
 
	+ New `BOOST\_REVERSE\_FOREACH`
	 macro for iterating over a sequence in reverse.
* [Function](/libs/function/index.html):

	+ Improved allocator support, from Emil Dotchevski.
* [Hash](/libs/functional/hash/index.html):
 Minor
 updates and fixes, for more info see the [change
 log](/doc/html/hash/changes.html#hash.changes.boost_1_36_0).
* [Interprocess](/libs/interprocess/index.html):

	+ Added anonymous shared memory for UNIX systems.
	+ Fixed missing move semantics on managed memory classes.
	+ Added copy\_on\_write and open\_read\_only options for shared memory
	 and mapped file managed classes.
	+ `shared\_ptr` is movable
	 and supports aliasing.
* [Intrusive](/libs/intrusive/index.html):

	+ Added `linear<>`
	 and `cache\_last<>`
	 options to singly linked lists.
	+ Added `optimize\_multikey<>` option to unordered container
	 hooks.
	+ Optimized unordered containers when `store\_hash`
	 option is used in the hook.
	+ Implementation changed to avoid explicit use of `try`-`catch` blocks and be compilable with
	 exceptions disabled.
* [Math](/libs/math/doc/sf_and_dist/html/index.html):

	+ Added new non-central Chi-Square, Beta, F and T distributions.
	+ Added Exponential Integral and Zeta special functions.
	+ Added Rounding, Truncation, and Unit-in-the-last-place functions.
	+ Added support for compile time powers of a runtime base.
	+ Added a few SSE2 based optimisations for the Lanczos approximations.
* [MPI](/doc/html/mpi.html):

	+ Added support for non-blocking operations in Python, from Andreas
	 Kl√∂ckner.
	+ Added support for graph topologies.
* [Multi-index Containers](/libs/multi_index/doc/index.html):
 Minor
 additions and maintenance fixes. Consult the library [release
 notes](/libs/multi_index/doc/release_notes.html#boost_1_36) for further information.
* [PtrContainer](/libs/ptr_container/index.html):
 Support
 for a few more containers, and addition of insert iterators. For details
 see [upgrading
 details](/libs/ptr_container/doc/ptr_container.html#upgrading-from-boost-v-1-35).
* [Spirit](/libs/spirit/index.html):
 Integrated the
 "Classic" Spirit V1.8.x code base with Spirit V2, "The New
 Generation". See [Change
 Log](/libs/spirit/classic/change_log.html).
* [Thread](/libs/thread/index.html):

	+ New generic `lock`
	 and `try\_lock` functions
	 for locking multiple mutexes at once.
	+ Rvalue reference support for move semantics where the compilers supports
	 it.
	+ A few bugs fixed and missing functions added (including the serious
	 win32 condition variable bug).
	+ `scoped\_try\_lock` types
	 are now backwards-compatible with Boost 1.34.0 and previous releases.
	+ Support for passing function arguments to the thread function by
	 supplying additional arguments to the `thread`
	 constructor.
	+ Backwards-compatibility overloads added for `timed\_lock`
	 and `timed\_wait` functions
	 to allow use of `xtime`
	 for timeouts.
* [Wave](/libs/wave/index.html):

	+ Wave V2.0 is a new major release introducing some breaking API changes,
	 preventing it to be used with Boost versions earlier than V1.36.0.
	 Mainly, the API and hook interface have been streamlined for more
	 consistency.
	+ Fixed a couple of bugs, improved regression test system to include
	 testing of the preporcessing hooks interface (for details see: [Changelog](/libs/wave/ChangeLog)).
* [Xpressive](/libs/xpressive/index.html):
 Regular
 expressions that can be written as strings or as expression templates,
 and that can refer to each other and themselves recursively with the power
 of context-free grammars, from Eric Niebler.
 
	+ `skip()`
	 for specifying which parts of the input sequence to ignore when matching
	 it against a regex.
	+ `regex\_replace()`
	 accepts formatter objects and formatter expressions in addition to
	 format strings.
	+ Range-based `regex\_replace()` algorithm.
	+ Fix crash when semantic actions are placed in look-aheads, look-behinds
	 or independent sub-expressions.
