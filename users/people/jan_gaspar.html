Jan Gaspar
==========

![-](jan_gaspar.jpg) Jan
 Gaspar is a software developer from Slovakia. He graduated at
 the [Slovak
 University of Technology](http://www.stu.sk) in Bratislava in 2000. He started
 programming in C++ at the university and worked on several C++
 projects since then. He thinks C++ is still a useful language
 although in the recent years his professional career moved more
 towards Java.


At present he works for a UK based company [IG Index](http://www.igindex.co.uk) so you
 are likely to meet him in the airspace between London and
 Slovakia.


Jan is married and has one son.


You can contact him by sending an e-mail to jano\_gaspar at
