Introduction
------------


Generic programming is about generalizing software
 components so that they can be easily reused in a wide variety
 of situations. In C++, class and function templates are
 particularly effective mechanisms for generic programming
 because they make the generalization possible without
 sacrificing efficiency.


As a simple example of generic programming, we will look at
 how one might generalize the `memcpy()` function of
 the C standard library. An implementation of
 `memcpy()` might look like the following:
```

void\* memcpy(void\* region1, const void\* region2, size\_t n)
{
  const char\* first = (const char\*)region2;
  const char\* last = ((const char\*)region2) + n;
  char\* result = (char\*)region1;
  while (first != last)
    \*result++ = \*first++;
  return result;
}

```

The `memcpy()` function is already generalized to
 some extent by the use of `void*` so that the
 function can be used to copy arrays of different kinds of data.
 But what if the data we would like to copy is not in an array?
 Perhaps it is in a linked list. Can we generalize the notion of
 copy to any sequence of elements? Looking at the body of
 `memcpy()`, the function's **minimal requirements** are that it needs to
 *traverse* through the sequence using some sort of
 pointer, *access* elements pointed to, *write* the
 elements to the destination, and *compare* pointers to
 know when to stop. The C++ standard library groups requirements
 such as these into **concepts**, in
 this case the [Input
 Iterator](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/InputIterator) concept (for `region2`) and the [Output
 Iterator](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/OutputIterator) concept (for `region1`).


If we rewrite the `memcpy()` as a function
 template, and use the [Input
 Iterator](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/InputIterator) and [Output
 Iterator](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/OutputIterator) concepts to describe the requirements on the
 template parameters, we can implement a highly reusable
 `copy()` function in the following way:
```

template <typename InputIterator, typename OutputIterator>
OutputIterator
copy(InputIterator first, InputIterator last, OutputIterator result)
{
  while (first != last)
    \*result++ = \*first++;
  return result;
}

```

Using the generic `copy()` function, we can now
 copy elements from any kind of sequence, including a linked
 list that exports iterators such as `std::[list](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/list)`.
```

#include <list>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  const int N = 3;
  std::vector<int> region1(N);
  std::list<int> region2;

  region2.push\_back(1);
  region2.push\_back(0);
  region2.push\_back(3);
  
  std::copy(region2.begin(), region2.end(), region1.begin());

  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
    std::cout << region1[i] << " ";
  std::cout << std::endl;
}

```

Anatomy of a
 Concept
---------------------


A **concept** is a set of
 requirements consisting of valid expressions, associated types,
 invariants, and complexity guarantees. A type that satisfies
 the requirements is said to **model**
 the concept. A concept can extend the requirements of another
 concept, which is called **refinement**.


* **Valid Expressions** are
 C++ expressions which must compile successfully for the
 objects involved in the expression to be considered
 *models* of the concept.
* **Associated Types** are
 types that are related to the modeling type in that they
 participate in one or more of the valid expressions.
 Typically associated types can be accessed either through
 typedefs nested within a class definition for the modeling
 type, or they are accessed through a [traits
 class](#traits).
* **Invariants** are run-time characteristics
 of the objects that must always be true, that is, the
 functions involving the objects must preserve these
 characteristics. The invariants often take the form of
 pre-conditions and post-conditions.
* **Complexity Guarantees** are maximum limits
 on how long the execution of one of the valid expressions
 will take, or how much of various resources its computation
 will use.


The concepts used in the C++ Standard Library are documented
 at the [C++ reference
 website](http://en.cppreference.com/w/).


Traits
------


A traits class provides a way of associating information
 with a compile-time entity (a type, integral constant, or
 address). For example, the class template [`std::iterator_traits<T>`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/iterator_traits)
 looks something like this:
```

template <class Iterator>
struct iterator\_traits {
  typedef ... iterator\_category;
  typedef ... value\_type;
  typedef ... difference\_type;
  typedef ... pointer;
  typedef ... reference;
};

```

The traits' `value_type` gives generic code the
 type which the iterator is "pointing at", while the
 `iterator_category` can be used to select more
 efficient algorithms depending on the iterator's
 capabilities.


A key feature of traits templates is that they're
 *non-intrusive*: they allow us to associate information
 with arbitrary types, including built-in types and types
 defined in third-party libraries, Normally, traits are
 specified for a particular type by (partially) specializing the
 traits template.


For an in-depth description of
 `std::iterator_traits`, see [this
 page](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/iterator_traits). Another very different expression of the traits idiom
 in the standard is `std::numeric_limits<T>`
 which provides constants describing the range and capabilities
 of numeric types.


Tag
 Dispatching
----------------


Tag dispatching is a way of using function overloading to
 dispatch based on properties of a type, and is often used hand
 in hand with traits classes. A good example of this synergy is
 the implementation of the [`std::advance()`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/advance) function in the C++ Standard
 Library, which increments an iterator `n` times.
 Depending on the kind of iterator, there are different
 optimizations that can be applied in the implementation. If the
 iterator is [random
 access](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/RandomAccessIterator) (can jump forward and backward arbitrary distances),
 then the `advance()` function can simply be
 implemented with `i += n`, and is very efficient:
 constant time. Other iterators must be `advance`d in
 steps, making the operation linear in n. If the iterator is
 [bidirectional](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/BidirectionalIterator), then it makes sense for `n` to be
 negative, so we must decide whether to increment or decrement
 the iterator.


The relation between tag dispatching and traits classes is
 that the property used for dispatching (in this case the
 `iterator_category`) is often accessed through a
 traits class. The main `advance()` function uses the
 [`iterator_traits`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/iterator_traits) class to get the
 `iterator_category`. It then makes a call the the
 overloaded `advance_dispatch()` function. The
 appropriate `advance_dispatch()` is selected by the
 compiler based on whatever type the `iterator_category`  resolves to, either [`input_iterator_tag`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/iterator_tags), [`bidirectional_iterator_tag`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/iterator_tags), or [`random_access_iterator_tag`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/iterator_tags). A **tag** is simply a class whose only purpose is to
 convey some property for use in tag dispatching and similar
 techniques. Refer to [this
 page](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/iterator_tags) for a more detailed description of iterator tags.
```

namespace std {
  struct input\_iterator\_tag { };
  struct bidirectional\_iterator\_tag { };
  struct random\_access\_iterator\_tag { };

  namespace detail {
    template <class InputIterator, class Distance>
    void advance\_dispatch(InputIterator& i, Distance n, **input\_iterator\_tag**) {
      while (n--) ++i;
    }

    template <class BidirectionalIterator, class Distance>
    void advance\_dispatch(BidirectionalIterator& i, Distance n, 
       **bidirectional\_iterator\_tag**) {
      if (n >= 0)
        while (n--) ++i;
      else
        while (n++) --i;
    }

    template <class RandomAccessIterator, class Distance>
    void advance\_dispatch(RandomAccessIterator& i, Distance n, 
       **random\_access\_iterator\_tag**) {
      i += n;
    }
  }

  template <class InputIterator, class Distance>
  void advance(InputIterator& i, Distance n) {
    typename **iterator\_traits<InputIterator>::iterator\_category** category;
    detail::advance\_dispatch(i, n, **category**);
  }
}

```

Adaptors
--------


An *adaptor* is a class template which builds on
 another type or types to provide a new interface or behavioral
 variant. Examples of standard adaptors are [std::reverse\_iterator](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/reverse_iterator),
 which adapts an iterator type by reversing its motion upon
 increment/decrement, and [std::stack](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/stack) , which adapts a container to provide a simple stack
 interface.


A more comprehensive review of the adaptors in the standard
 can be found [here](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=249118.249120).


Type
 Generators
----------------


**Note:** The *type generator* concept has
 largely been superseded by the more refined notion of a
 [metafunction](/doc/libs/release/libs/mpl/doc/refmanual/metafunction.html).
 See *[C++
 Template Metaprogramming](http://www.boost-consulting.com/mplbook/)* for an in-depth discussion of
 metafunctions.


A *type generator* is a template whose only purpose is
 to synthesize a new type or types based on its template
 argument(s)[[1]](#footnote1). The generated type is
 usually expressed as a nested typedef named, appropriately
 `type`. A type generator is usually used to
 consolidate a complicated type expression into a simple one.
 This example uses an old version of [`iterator_adaptor`](/doc/libs/release/libs/iterator/doc/iterator_adaptor.html) whose design didn't allow derived
 iterator types. As a result, every adapted iterator had to be a
 specialization of `iterator_adaptor` itself and
 generators were a convenient way to produce those types.
```

template <class Predicate, class Iterator, 
    class Value = *complicated default*,
    class Reference = *complicated default*,
    class Pointer = *complicated default*,
    class Category = *complicated default*,
    class Distance = *complicated default*
         >
struct filter\_iterator\_generator {
    typedef iterator\_adaptor<
        
        Iterator,filter\_iterator\_policies<Predicate,Iterator>,
        Value,Reference,Pointer,Category,Distance> **type**;
};

```

Now, that's complicated, but producing an adapted filter
 iterator using the generator is much easier. You can usually
 just write:
```

boost::filter\_iterator\_generator<my\_predicate,my\_base\_iterator>::type

```

Object
 Generators
------------------


An *object generator* is a function template whose only
 purpose is to construct a new object out of its arguments.
 Think of it as a kind of generic constructor. An object
 generator may be more useful than a plain constructor when the
 exact type to be generated is difficult or impossible to
 express and the result of the generator can be passed directly
 to a function rather than stored in a variable. Most Boost
 object generators are named with the prefix
 "`make_`", after `std::[make\_pair](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/pair/make_pair)(const T&, const U&)`.


For example, given:
```

struct widget {
  void tweak(int);
};
std::vector<widget \*> widget\_ptrs;

```

By chaining two standard object generators,
 `std::[bind2nd](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/bind12)()`
 and `std::[mem\_fun](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/mem_fun)()`,
 we can easily tweak all widgets:
```

void tweak\_all\_widgets1(int arg)
{
   for\_each(widget\_ptrs.begin(), widget\_ptrs.end(),
      **bind2nd**(std::**mem\_fun**(&widget::tweak), arg));
}

```

Without using object generators the example above would look
 like this:
```

void tweak\_all\_widgets2(int arg)
{
   for\_each(struct\_ptrs.begin(), struct\_ptrs.end(),
      **std::binder2nd<std::mem\_fun1\_t<void, widget, int> >**(
          std::**mem\_fun1\_t<void, widget, int>**(&widget::tweak), arg));
}

```

As expressions get more complicated the need to reduce the
 verbosity of type specification gets more compelling.


Policy Classes
--------------


A policy class is a template parameter used to transmit
 behavior. An example from the standard library is
 `std::[allocator](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/allocator)`,
 which supplies memory management behaviors to standard [containers](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container).


Policy classes have been explored in detail by [Andrei Alexandrescu](http://www.moderncppdesign.com/) in
 [this
 chapter](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=167842) of his book, *Modern C++ Design*. He
 writes:
> 
> In brief, policy-based class design fosters assembling a
>  class with complex behavior out of many little classes
>  (called policies), each of which takes care of only one
>  behavioral or structural aspect. As the name suggests, a
>  policy establishes an interface pertaining to a specific
>  issue. You can implement policies in various ways as long as
>  you respect the policy interface.
> 
> 
> Because you can mix and match policies, you can achieve a
>  combinatorial set of behaviors by using a small core of
>  elementary components.
> 
> 
> 


Andrei's description of policy classes suggests that their
 power is derived from granularity and orthogonality.
 Less-granular policy interfaces have been shown to work well in
 practice, though. [This paper](http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/tags/release/Boost_1_30_2/boost/libs/utility/iterator_adaptors.pdf) describes an old version of [`iterator_adaptor`](/doc/libs/release/libs/iterator/doc/iterator_adaptor.html) that used non-orthogonal policies.
 There is also precedent in the standard library: [`std::char_traits`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/char_traits), despite its name, acts as a
 policies class that determines the behaviors of [std::basic\_string](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string).
