#### 
[Introduction](value_init.html#utility.utilities.value_init.introduction "Introduction")
 Constructing and initializing objects in a generic way is difficult in
 C++. The problem is that there are several different rules that apply for
 initialization. Depending on the type, the value of a newly constructed
 object can be zero-initialized (logically 0), default-constructed (using
 the default constructor), or indeterminate. When writing generic code,
 this problem must be addressed. The template [`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized") provides a solution
 with consistent syntax for value initialization of scalar, union and class
 types. Moreover, [`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized") offers a workaround
 to various compiler issues regarding value-initialization.
 
 Furthermore, a `const` object
 [`initialized\_value`](../../boost/initialized_value.html "Global initialized_value")
 is provided, to avoid repeating the type name when retrieving the value
 from a `[`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized")<T>` object.
 
 There are various ways to initialize a variable, in C++. The following
 declarations all *may* have a local variable initialized
 to its default value:
 
```
T1 var1;
T2 var2 = 0;
T3 var3 = {};
T4 var4 = T4();

```


 Unfortunately, whether or not any of those declarations correctly initialize
 the variable very much depends on its type. The first declaration is valid
 for any [*DefaultConstructible*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/DefaultConstructible)
 type by definition.
 
 However, it does not always do an initialization. It correctly initializes
 the variable when it's an instance of a class, and the author of the class
 has provided a proper default constructor. On the other hand, the value
 of `var1` is *indeterminate*
 when its type is an arithmetic type, like `int`,
 `float`, or `char`.
 
 An arithmetic variable is of course initialized properly by the second
 declaration, `T2 var2
= 0`.
 But this initialization form will not usually work for a class type, unless
 the class was especially written to support being initialized that way.
 
 The third form, `T3 var3
= {}`,
 initializes an aggregate, typically a "C-style" `struct` or a "C-style" array. However,
 at the time this library was developed, the syntax did not allow for a
 class that has an explicitly declared constructor.
 
 The fourth form is the most generic form of them, as it can be used to
 initialize arithmetic types, class types, aggregates, pointers, and other
 types. The declaration, `T4 var4 = T4()`,
 should be read as follows: First a temporary object is created, by `T4()`.
 This object is [value-initialized](value_init.html#sec:valueinit).
 Next the temporary object is copied to the named variable, `var4`. Afterwards, the temporary is destroyed.
 While the copying and the destruction are likely to be optimized away,
 C++ still requires the type `T4`
 to be [*CopyConstructible*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/CopyConstructible).
 So `T4` needs to be *both*
[*DefaultConstructible*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/DefaultConstructible)
*and* [*CopyConstructible*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/CopyConstructible).
 
 A class may not be CopyConstructible, for example because it may have a
 private and undefined copy constructor, or because it may be derived from
 `boost::noncopyable`. Scott Meyers [[2](value_init.html#sec:references)]
 explains why a class would be defined like that.
 
 There is another, less obvious disadvantage to the fourth form, `T4 var4
= T4()`: It suffers from various [compiler
 issues](value_init.html#sec:compiler_issues), causing a variable to be left uninitialized in some compiler
 specific cases.
 
 The template [`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized")
 offers a generic way to initialize an object, like `T4
var4 =
T4()`,
 but without requiring its type to be [*CopyConstructible*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/CopyConstructible).
 And it offers a workaround to those compiler issues regarding value-initialization
 as well. It allows getting an initialized variable of any type; it *only*
 requires the type to be [*DefaultConstructible*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/DefaultConstructible).
 A properly *value-initialized* object of type `T` is constructed by the following declaration:
 
```
value\_initialized<T> var;

```


 The template [`initialized`](../../boost/initialized.html "Class template initialized")
 offers both value-initialization and direct-initialization. It is especially
 useful as a data member type, allowing the very same object to be either
 direct-initialized or value-initialized.
 
 The `const` object [`initialized\_value`](../../boost/initialized_value.html "Global initialized_value") allows value-initializing
 a variable as follows:
 
```
T var = initialized\_value;

```


 This form of initialization is semantically equivalent to `T4 var4
= T4()`, but robust against the aforementioned
 compiler issues.
 

#### 
[Details](value_init.html#utility.utilities.value_init.details "Details")
 The C++ standard [[3](value_init.html#sec:references)] contains the
 definitions of `zero-initialization` and `default-initialization`.
 Informally, zero-initialization means that the object is given the initial
 value `0` converted to the type
 and default-initialization means that [POD](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/PODType)
 [[4](value_init.html#sec:references)] types are zero-initialized, while
 non-POD class types are initialized with their corresponding default constructors.
 
 A *declaration* can contain an *initializer*,
 which specifies the object's initial value. The initializer can be just
 '()', which states that the object shall be value-initialized (but see
 below). However, if a *declaration* has no *initializer*
 and it is of a non-`const`,
 non-`static` POD type, the initial
 value is indeterminate: (see §8.5, [dcl.init], for the accurate definitions).
 
```
int x; // no initializer. x value is indeterminate.
[`std::string`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string) s; // no initializer, s is default-constructed.

int y = int();
// y is initialized using copy-initialization
// but the temporary uses an empty set of parentheses as the initializer,
// so it is default-constructed.
// A default constructed POD type is zero-initialized,
// therefore, y == 0.

void foo ( [`std::string`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string) ) ;
foo ( [`std::string`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string)() ) ;
// the temporary string is default constructed
// as indicated by the initializer ()

```

###### 

[value-initialization](value_init.html#utility.utilities.value_init.details.value_initialization)
 The first [Technical
 Corrigendum for the C++ Standard](http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/cwg_defects.html) (TC1), whose draft was released
 to the public in November 2001, introduced [Core
 Issue 178](http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/cwg_defects.html#178), among many other issues.
 
 That issue introduced the new concept of `value-initialization`,
 and also fixed the wording for zero-initialization. Informally, value-initialization
 is similar to default-initialization with the exception that in some cases
 non-static data members and base class sub-objects are also value-initialized.
 
 The difference is that an object that is value-initialized will not have,
 or at least is less likely to have, indeterminate values for data members
 and base class sub-objects; unlike the case of an object default constructed
 (see Core Issue 178 for a normative description).
 
 In order to specify value-initialization of an object we need to use the
 empty-set initializer: `()`.
 
 As before, a declaration with no initializer specifies default-initialization,
 and a declaration with a non-empty initializer specifies copy (`=xxx`)
 or direct (`xxx`) initialization.
 
```
template<class T> void eat(T);

int x ; // indeterminate initial value.

[`std::string`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string) s; // default-initialized.

eat ( int() ) ; // value-initialized

eat ( [`std::string`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string)() ) ; // value-initialized

```

###### 

[value-initialization
 syntax](value_init.html#utility.utilities.value_init.details.value_initialization_syntax)
 Value initialization is specified using `()`.
 However, the empty set of parentheses is not permitted by the syntax of
 initializers because it is parsed as the declaration of a function taking
 no arguments:
 
```
int x() ; // declares function int(\*)()

```


 Thus, the empty `()` must be
 put in some other initialization context.
 
 One alternative is to use copy-initialization syntax:
 
```
int x = int();

```


 This works perfectly fine for POD types. But for non-POD class types, copy-initialization
 searches for a suitable constructor, which could be, for instance, the
 copy-constructor. It also searches for a suitable conversion sequence but
 this does not apply in this context.
 
 For an arbitrary unknown type, using this syntax may not have the value-initialization
 effect intended because we don't know if a copy from a default constructed
 object is exactly the same as a default constructed object, and the compiler
 is allowed, in some cases, but never required to, optimize the copy away.
 
 One possible generic solution is to use value-initialization of a non static
 data member:
 
```
template<class T>
struct W
{
    // value-initialization of 'data' here.
    W() : data() {}

    T data;
};

W<int> w;
// w.data is value-initialized for any type.

```


 This is the solution as it was supplied by earlier versions of the `[`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized")<T>` template class. Unfortunately this
 approach suffered from various compiler issues.
 


###### 

[Compiler
 issues](value_init.html#utility.utilities.value_init.details.compiler_issues)
 Various compilers have not yet fully implemented value-initialization.
 So when an object should be *value-initialized* according
 to the C++ Standard, it *may* in practice still be left
 uninitialized, because of those compiler issues. It is hard to make a general
 statement on what those issues are like, because they depend on the compiler
 you are using, its version number, and the type of object you would like
 to have value-initialized.
 
 All compilers we have tested so far support value-initialization for arithmetic
 types properly. However, various compilers may leave some types of *aggregates*
 uninitialized, when they should be value-initialized. Value-initialization
 of objects of a pointer-to-member type may also go wrong on various compilers.
 
 At the moment of writing, May 2010, the following reported issues regarding
 value-initialization are still there in current compiler releases:
 


* [Microsoft

 Note that all known GCC issues regarding value-initialization are fixed
 with GCC version 4.4, including [GCC
 Bug 30111](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=30111). Clang also has completely implemented value-initialization,
 as far as we know, now that [Clang
 Bug 7139](http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=7139) is fixed.
 
 New versions of [`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized")
 (Boost release version 1.35 or higher) offer a workaround to these issues:
 [`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized")
 may now clear its internal data, prior to constructing the object that
 it contains. It will do so for those compilers that need to have such a
 workaround, based on the [compiler
 defect macro](../../../../../../libs/config/doc/html/boost_config/boost_macro_reference.html#boost_config.boost_macro_reference.macros_that_describe_defects) `BOOST\_NO\_COMPLETE\_VALUE\_INITIALIZATION`.

 An object of this template class is a `T`-wrapper
 convertible to `'T&'` whose
 wrapped object (data member of type `T`)
 is [value-initialized](value_init.html#sec:valueinit) upon default-initialization
 of this wrapper class:
 
```
int zero = 0;
[`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized")<int> x;
assert( x == zero ) ;

[`std::string`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string) def;
[`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized")< [`std::string`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string) > y;
assert( y == def ) ;

```


 The purpose of this wrapper is to provide a consistent syntax for value
 initialization of scalar, union and class types (POD and non-POD) since
 the correct syntax for value initialization varies (see [value-initialization
 syntax](value_init.html#sec:valueinitsyn)).
 
 The wrapped object can be accessed either through the conversion operator
 `T&`,
 the member function `data()`, or the non-member function `get()`:
 
```
void watch(int);

[`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized")<int> x;

watch(x) ; // operator T& used.
watch(x.data());
watch( get(x) ) // function get() used

```


 Both `const` and non-`const` objects can be wrapped. Mutable
 objects can be modified directly from within the wrapper but constant
 objects cannot:
 
 When `T` is a [*Swappable*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Swappable)
 type, `[`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized")<T>` is swappable as well, by calling
 its `swap` member function
 as well as by calling `boost::swap`.
 
```
[`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized")<int> x;
static\_cast<int&>(x) = 1 ; // OK
get(x) = 1 ; // OK

[`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized")<int const> y ;
static\_cast<int&>(y) = 1 ; // ERROR: cannot cast to int&
static\_cast<int const&>(y) = 1 ; // ERROR: cannot modify a const value
get(y) = 1 ; // ERROR: cannot modify a const value

```

| [Warning] | Warning |
| 
 The [`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized")
 implementation of Boost version 1.40.0 and older allowed *non-const*
 access to the wrapped object, from a constant wrapper, both by its
 conversion operator and its `data()` member function.
 

 For example:
 

```
[`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized")<int> const x\_c;
int& xr = x\_c ; // OK, conversion to int& available even though x\_c is itself const.
xr = 2 ;

```


 The reason for this obscure behavior was that some compilers did not
 accept the following valid code:
 

```
struct X
{
  operator int&() ;
    operator int const&() const ;
  };
  X x ;
  (x == 1) ; // ERROR HERE!

```


 The current version of [`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized") no longer
 has this obscure behavior. As compilers nowadays widely support overloading
 the conversion operator by having a `const`
 and a `non-const` version, we have decided to fix
 the issue accordingly. So the current version supports the idea of
 logical constness.

[Recommended
 practice: The non-member get() idiom](value_init.html#utility.utilities.value_init.types_and_objects.template_class_value_initialized.recommended_practice_the_non_mem)
 The obscure behavior of being able to modify a non-`const`
 wrapped object from within a constant wrapper (as was supported by previous
 versions of [`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized"))
 can be avoided if access to the wrapped object is always performed with
 the `get()`
 idiom:
 
```
value\_initialized<int> x;
get(x) = 1; // OK
value\_initialized<int const> cx;
get(x) = 1; // ERROR: Cannot modify a const object

value\_initialized<int> const x\_c;
get(x\_c) = 1; // ERROR: Cannot modify a const object

value\_initialized<int const> const cx\_c;
get(cx\_c) = 1; // ERROR: Cannot modify a const object

} // namespace boost

```


 The template class `boost::[`initialized`](../../boost/initialized.html "Class template initialized")<T>`
 supports both value-initialization and direct-initialization, so its
 interface is a superset of the interface of `[`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized")<T>`:
 Its default-constructor value-initializes the wrapped object just like
 the default-constructor of `[`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized")<T>`,
 but `boost::[`initialized`](../../boost/initialized.html "Class template initialized")<T>` also offers an extra `explicit` constructor, which direct-initializes
 the wrapped object by the specified value.
 
`[`initialized`](../../boost/initialized.html "Class template initialized")<T>` is especially useful when the wrapped
 object must be either value-initialized or direct-initialized, depending
 on runtime conditions. For example, `[`initialized`](../../boost/initialized.html "Class template initialized")<T>`
 could hold the value of a data member that may be value-initialized by
 some constructors, and direct-initialized by others.
 
 On the other hand, if it is known beforehand that the object must *always*
 be value-initialized, `[`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized")<T>`
 may be preferable. And if the object must always be direct-initialized,
 none of the two wrappers really needs to be used.

    template <class T> operator T() const ;
};

[`initialized\_value\_t`](../../boost/initialized_value_t.html "Class initialized_value_t") const initialized\_value = {} ;

} // namespace boost

```


[`initialized\_value`](../../boost/initialized_value.html "Global initialized_value")
 provides a convenient way to get an initialized value: its conversion
 operator provides an appropriate *value-initialized*
 object for any [*CopyConstructible*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/CopyConstructible)
 type.
 
 Suppose you need to have an initialized variable of type `T`. You could do it as follows:
 
```
T var = T();

```


 But as mentioned before, this form suffers from various compiler issues.
 The template [`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized")
 offers a workaround:
 
```
T var = get( [`value\_initialized`](../../boost/value_initialized.html "Class template value_initialized")<T>() );

```


 Unfortunately both forms repeat the type name, which is rather short
 now (`T`), but could of
 course be more like `Namespace::Template<Arg>::Type`.
 
 Instead, one could use [`initialized\_value`](../../boost/initialized_value.html "Global initialized_value") as follows:
 
```
T var = [`initialized\_value`](../../boost/initialized_value.html "Global initialized_value");

```

`boost::[`initialized`](../../boost/initialized.html "Class template initialized")`
 was very much inspired by feedback from Edward Diener and Jeffrey Hellrung.
 
[`initialized\_value`](../../boost/initialized_value.html "Global initialized_value")
 was written by Niels Dekker, and added to Boost release version 1.36 (2008).
