Howard Hinnant
==============

![-](howard_hinnant.jpg)
 When Howard Hinnant is not monkeying around, he is a software
 engineer for Apple and represents Apple on the C++ Standards
 committee as Library Working Group Chairman.  Howard has
 is also one of the co-authors / co-inventors of the rvalue
 reference work for C++09 making move semantics and perfect
 forwarding practical in C++.  In the past Howard was the
 principal author of the CodeWarrior C++ library.


Howard is married with four children, four dogs (he really
 isn't that fond of dogs), a rabbit, several exotic lizards with
 the usual accompaniment of insects (which the lizards are
 supposed to eat but find more entertaining to turn loose in the
 house), um... let's see ... fish, wild mice (they eventually
 kidnapped all the domesticated rodents), several dozen chickens
 (no I'm not kidding)...  The neighbors are trying to turn
 my property into a federally protected wildlife preserve. 
 They've got a fighting chance ... the kids alone would
 qualify.


When not sitting in front of his computer, Howard enjoys
 snow skiing and ... more, snow skiing.
