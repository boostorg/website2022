 - Dates, times, leap seconds, infinity, and more, from Jeff Garland.

 class from Jeremy Siek and Chuck Allison.
* [Format Library](/libs/format/index.html) added -
 Type-safe 'printf-like' format operations, from Samuel Krempp.
* [Function Library](/libs/function/index.html): Major

 improved on conforming compilers. Please see the compatibility note for more
 information.

 added
 - Multidimensional containers and adaptors for arrays of contiguous data,

 works on many more compilers and platforms, with a completely new interface
 and lots of new features. Boost.Python v2 requires Python 2.2 or later.
* [Signals Library](/libs/signals/doc/index.html) added
 - Managed signals & slots callback implementation, from Doug Gregor.
* [Test Library](/libs/test/doc/index.html): Major
 new version, including full unit test capabilities, from Gennadiy Rozental.

 Walter and Mathias Koch.
