![-](ed_brey.jpg) Ed Brey
 lives in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, a village outside of
 Milwaukee. In the summertime, he likes to play tennis with his
 wife, and in the winter, if there is enough snow, he likes to
 go tobogganing or ice-skating. If it is not nice enough outside
 for either of those, he plays on the piano.


Ed works at [Eaton Corporation](http://www.eaton.com) in Milwaukee. He started
 working there as part of [Marquette University](http://www.mu.edu)'s engineering co-op
 program. Upon graduation in 1995 from Marquette with a BS in
 electrical and computer engineering, he was hired on full-time,
 where he initially worked on firmware for industrial controls.
 More recently, he has been working on a PC-based configuration
 tool for industrial networks. Ed received his MS in computer
 engineering in 2001 from [NTU](http://www.ntu.edu).


Ed has held programming as a pastime since his grade school
 days, when he wrote a babysitting invoicing program. Soon
 after, he wrote a game inspired by the TV game show
 “Press Your Luck”. Ever since, programming
 languages and concepts, along with finding ways to improve the
 art and science of coding software, have always peeked his
 interest.


Lastly, Ed has managed to retain his perspective. As fun as
 computers and programming are, Ed's true loves in life are the
 Lord Jesus whom he serves and his dear wife Beth.
