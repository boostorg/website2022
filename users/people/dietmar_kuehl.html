=============

 Dietmar Kuehl (the "ue" is actually a "u-umlaut", ie. one of
 those funny German characters which has two dots above it) was
 fork(2)ed in early 1968.


He visited school more or less successfully from 1973 to
 1987. In 1987 he started to study at the Technical University
 of Berlin. He finished his studies in 1997 with a Diplom
 (roughly the German equivalent of a masters) in Mathematics.
 His [thesis](http://www.dietmar-kuehl.de/generic-graph-algorithms.pdf) was "Design Pattern for the
 Implementation of Graph Algorithms"; strike the "Design
 Pattern" and put in "Generic" somehow to get an idea of the
 main topic.


Since 1997 he has worked as consultant for a small company
 called Claas Solutions (the "aa" is no typo), mainly working
 for major German banks. Since late 1995 Dietmar Kuehl has been
 one of the moderators of the newsgroup [comp.lang.c++.moderated](news:comp.lang.c++.moderated). He is active on the C++
 Standards committee.
