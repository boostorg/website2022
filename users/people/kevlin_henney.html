=============

 Kevlin Henney (<mailto:kevlin@curbralan.com>, <http://www.curbralan.com>) is an independent
 consultant and trainer based in the UK. He has developed and
 delivered training course material and consultancy on many
 aspects of OO development, which he has practiced across a
 number of domains for longer than he cares (or can) remember.
 His professional interests include patterns, OO and
 component-based design, architecture, distributed object
 systems, and languages, including C++, C#, Java, and Ruby. He
 is also a member of the BSI C++ standards committee.


Now that writing code is no longer the core responsibility
 of his job, his non-professional interests seem to include the
 hacking associated with the aforementioned professional
 interests. However, never being one to keep something to
 himself (like C++'s relationship with C, this is regarded as
 both a strength and a weakness), he shares/inflicts (delete as
 necessary) his professional and non-professional development
 experiences with/on (ditto) others through writing articles and
 presenting tutorials, workshops and papers at conferences.


He is married, and not just to his work. He and Carolyn have
 one child, Stefan. The little spare time that remains to him is
 taken up with music, reading, pub appreciation, etc. Although
 with a newborn, there is more reading and less pub appreciation
 (pubs are still appreciated, but more in memory than in
 interaction). Finally, although he enjoys writing, Kevlin is
 not really one for writing in the third person.
