Joel de Guzman
==============

![-](joel_de_guzman.jpg)Joel got into electronics and programming in the 80s because almost everything in music, his first love, is becoming electronic and digital. Back then, he used to build his own guitars, effect boxes and synths. He enjoys playing distortion-laden rock guitar, composes and produces his own music in his home studio. 


Joel de Guzman is the main author of the [Boost.Spirit Parser](https://www.boost.org/libs/spirit) library, the [Boost.Fusion](https://www.boost.org/libs/fusion) library and the [Boost.Phoenix](http://boost-spirit.com/home/spirit2/libs/spirit/phoenix/doc/html/index.html) library. He has been a professional software architect and engineer since 1987. Joel specializes in high quality, cross platform libraries, particularly—but not limited to—those written in C and C++. Joel is an expert practitioner of modern C++ techniques, template metaprogramming and functional programming, with a focus on generic programming and library-centric design. He’s very happy and enthusiastic with his current job as a consultant and engineer at [BoostPro Computing](http://www.boostpro.com). 
 
Recently, Joel got into building guitars again. You can see him in action at [http://www.cycfi.com.](http://www.cycfi.com)
