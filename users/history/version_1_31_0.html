### New License
 A unified [Boost Software
 License](/doc/libs/1_31_0/more/license_info.html) has been developed and will gradually replace the individual
 licenses for most Boost libraries. The new license offers better legal protection
 for both users and developers, and should speed user's legal reviews of Boost
 libraries. Dave Abrahams led the Boost effort to develop better licensing.
 The legal team was led by [Diane
 Cabell](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/cabell/index.html), Director, Clinical Programs, [Berkman
 Center for Internet & Society](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu), Harvard Law School. [Devin
 Smith](http://www.nixonpeabody.com/attorneys_detail1.asp?ID=121), attorney, [Nixon
 Peabody LLP](http://www.nixonpeabody.com/default.asp), wrote the Boost License. Eva Chan, Harvard Law School,
 contributed analysis of issues and drafts of various legal documents.
 
 Note: Many of the Boost libraries are still using earlier licenses, though
 all conform to the [Boost
 License Requirements](/doc/libs/1_31_0/more/lib_guide.htm#license). After this release we will begin an effort to
 move toward uniform use of the new license.
 

### Build and Installation


* New [Getting Started](/doc/libs/1_31_0/more/getting_started.html)
 procedures ease download and installation, from Rene Rivera and others.
* Improved support for libraries requiring [separate
 compilation](/doc/libs/1_31_0/more/separate_compilation.html), from John Maddock and others.

### New Libraries


* [enable\_if](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/utility/enable_if.html): Selective
 inclusion of function template overloads, from Jaakko Jarvi, Jeremiah Willcock,
 and Andrew Lumsdaine. This is an important new technique which exploits
 the SFINAE (substitution-failure-is-not-an-error) principle.
* [Variant Library](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/variant/index.html): Safe,
 generic, stack-based discriminated union container, from Eric Friedman
 and Itay Maman.

### Updated Libraries


* [Compose](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/compose/index.htm): This
 library has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use
 [Bind](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/bind/bind.html) or [Lambda](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/lambda/doc/index.html) instead.
* [Date
 Time Library](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/date_time/doc/index.html): A whole host of bug fixes, new features, and documentation
 improvements. See the Date Time Change History for details.
* [Filesystem
 Library](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/filesystem/doc/index.htm):
 Several added functions, including improved checking for
 directory and file name portability.
* [Iterator
 Library](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/iterator/doc/index.html): Major version upgrade, with interface as proposed for the
 C++ library TR, including an improved iterator\_adaptor
 design plus several new components, from David Abrahams, Jeremy Siek, and
 Thomas Witt.
* [MultiArray](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/multi_array/index.html): The
 multi\_array class template now provides an element-preserving
 resize operation as well as default construction (see the [reference
 manual](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/multi_array/doc/reference.html) for more information).
* [Python Library](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/python/index.html):

	+ Support for Python 2.3 and Intel C++ on Linux
	+ Container [Indexing
	 Suite](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/python/doc/v2/indexing.html) added.
	+ injected constructors and wrapped function objects.
	+ wrapping static data members.
	+ `std::wstring` conversions.
	+ Improved [keyword
	 arguments](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/python/doc/v2/args.html).
	+ Better error messages, including name demangling for GCC.
	+ Simpler [build
	 procedure](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/python/doc/building.html).
	+ *...and more....*
* [Random Number
 Library](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/random/index.html): Interface changed to match the C++ [TR
 proposal](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/random/wg21-proposal.html), from Jens Maurer.
* [Regex](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/regex/doc/index.html): Completely
 new matching algorithm is now much faster than before, plus a selection
 of [new features
 and enhancements](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/regex/doc/history.html).
* [Boost.Spirit
 1.8.0](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/spirit/index.html):

	+ Multiple grammar start rules
	+ Multiple Scanner rules (no more scanner business woes)
	+ More dynamic parsers
	+ Predefined actors
	+ Numerous bug fixes and QOI stuff
	+ *and more...*

 Starting from Spirit v1.8.0, ill conforming compilers will no longer be
 supported. If you are still using one of these older compilers, please use
 Spirit v1.6.x. See [@http://spirit.sf.net Spirit's Site] for more details.
* [Test Library](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/test/index.html):

	+ Free function template based test case
	+ Custom exception translators support in execution monitor and
	 register\_exception\_translator added for unit test framework
	+ Added support for multi-module unit tests in automatic
	 registration facility
	+ Floating point comparison algorithm reworked (Is not backward
	 compatible!!!)
	+ Added support for custom users predicate returning both boolean
	 result code and possibly error message
	+ Documentation structure rework and update

 For a complete list of changes see the Test Library
 [release notes](/doc/libs/1_31_0/libs/test/doc/release_notes.html#v1_31_0).

### Miscellaneous


* Expanded testing and fixes for non-conforming compilers.
* Web site hosting now provided by [SourceForge](http://www.sourceforge.net/).
