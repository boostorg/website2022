 I just sent an email to user list asking if anyone is using old compilers, I'll
 repeat it here:

**Update:** I had a few responses, but none were
 opposed to this change, so I made it in trunk a little while ago. It should be
 included in the next release.
 
 There was some concern that we would remove support for later compilers (e.g.
 Visual Studio 2008, aka. Visual C++ 9.0). We have no such plans, this change
 is only for very old compilers. As always support across Boost libraries is not
 uniform, but most library authors do try to support as wide a range of compilers
 as is feasible.
