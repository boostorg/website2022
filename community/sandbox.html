Boost Sandbox



Boost Sandbox
=============

When boost was developed using subversion, the Boost Sandbox
 contained unreviewed code that is intended to eventually become
 a part of the Boost libraries. New libraries should be
 developed separately as [git
 modules](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/ModularBoost), and existing projects should be [moved to
 GitHub](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/ExtractSandbox). The sandbox remains as a historical record.


Accessing the Boost Sandbox
---------------------------


The Boost Sandbox lives at <https://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox>
 within the old Boost Subversion repository.


Organization
------------


Because there were typically many projects in the sandbox at
 any one time (in various stages of development), the sandbox
 should have been organized by project. Each project should have
 had its own subdirectory inside sandbox. For example,
 an XML library would reside in sandbox/xml. Inside
 that project-specific subdirectory, the project would be
 organized like any other Boost library, with a boost
 subdirectory (for headers) and libs subdirectory (for
 source code, build files, and documentation). Our hypothetical
 XML project would likely have had the following structure:


* sandbox/xml/
	+ boost/ - Contains xml.hpp, which
	 includes all of the headers from xml/
		- xml/ - Contains Boost.XML headers
	+ libs/
		- xml/
			* build/ - Contains Jamfiles
			 to build Boost.XML
			* doc/ - Contains documentation for
			 Boost.XML
			* src/ - Contains Boost.XML compiled
			 source files


Many existing projects in the sandbox didn't follow this
 structure, opting to place headers in sandbox/boost
 and supporting files in sandbox/libs.
