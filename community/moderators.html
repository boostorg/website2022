Moderators



Boost Moderators
================

The Boost moderators are [Dave Abrahams](/users/people/dave_abrahams.html), Carl
 Daniel, [Beman
 Dawes](/users/people/beman_dawes.html), [Jeff
 Garland](/users/people/jeff_garland.html), [Doug
 Gregor](/users/people/doug_gregor.html), and [John
 Maddock](/users/people/john_maddock.html). You can reach the moderators at [boost-owner@lists.boost.org](mailto:boost-owner@lists.boost.org).


**Note:** The boost moderators do not moderate any
 mailing lists other than the main Boost developers' list. For
 example, the boost-users list moderators are at [boost-users-owner@lists.boost.org](mailto:boost-users-owner@lists.boost.org).
 The moderators of [every other
 Boost list](/community/groups.html) can be reached through its home page.


Moderator Functions
-------------------


* Monitor the mailing list to ensure dialog remains within
 the acceptable boundaries set by the [discussion policy](/community/policy.html). When
 discussion strays, use private email to gently remind,
 strongly rebuke, or outright ban, as the situation
 demands.


* Approve the initial postings of new (and thus still
 moderated) members, and move members to the "Group Policy"
 posting status.


* Administer the internal operations of the Boost web site,
 the main Boost mailing list, the CVS repository, and other
 Boost administrative machinery.


* Act as an executive committee overseeing important
 administrative and policy decisions. Boost is a zero-budget
 organization with no income and no expenses, so that
 eliminates the need for most management. Technical decisions
 are worked out on the mailing list. The moderators handle the
 few remaining decisions that need a definite answer.


* Beyond the purely administrative duties, work to keep the
 Boost community vibrant and alive. That may be as simple as
 saying "thank you" to an individual member, or as complex as
 starting some major new initiative. Do whatever it
 takes!
