Requesting New Features



Requesting new features for Boost libraries
===========================================

If you have an idea for a feature or improvement to an
 existing Boost library - go ahead and post it to either
 [boost-users list](/community/groups.html#users) or
 [boost mailing list](/community/groups.html#main)
 (if you are posting for the first time, please read our
 [discussion
 policy](https://www.boost.org/more/discussion_policy.htm) before you actually post).


You can also try submitting a feature request to our
 [issue tracker](https://github.com/boostorg/)
 on GitHub, but experience has shown that posting to either of the mailing lists is usually a more effective way to get attention
 of boost developers.


If your proposal has its merits, it's very likely that it
 will generate a constructive discussion that might actually
 result in (sometimes substantial) improvement of the library -
 and your name being put on the library's [Acknowledgements](/development/requirements.html#Acknowledgements)
 section!
