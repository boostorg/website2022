==============

Version 1.18.2
--------------


November 3rd, 2000 12:00 GMT

* [Cast Library](/libs/conversion/cast.htm) Fix numeric\_cast<>
 bugs with floating types.
* [Graph Library](/libs/graph/doc/table_of_contents.html)
 minor
 fixes.
* [Regular Expression Library](/libs/regex/index.html) minor
 fixes.
* [Configuration Header](/libs/config/index.html) more
 fixes for broken compilers.
* Boost Header Dependencies page added.
* Terminology change: Several headers previously lumped together as a "utility"
 library are now considered separate libraries. For historical reasons, their
 non-header files still live in the "utility" sub-directory.
