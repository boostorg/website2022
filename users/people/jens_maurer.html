===========

![-](jens_maurer.jpg) Jens
 Maurer is a software developer from Germany who lives close to
 Frankfurt/Main. He was born in 1973 and hasn't died yet.


He has worked for a multimedia company programming
 home-banking applications, CGI scripts and Java applications.
 He also helped program some simulation systems for long-term
 decision support to aid businessmen in arguing about company
 investments.


He is neither married nor does he have a girl friend, but
 asked his colleagues to find one for him.


In his spare time, he likes visiting foreign countries but
 dislikes getting there in uncomfortable airplane seats. On
 random week-ends, he enjoys participating in historic dance
 courses (without a costume, of course). Sometimes, he needs
 fresh air and goes for a walk.
