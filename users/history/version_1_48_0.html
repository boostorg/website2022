### Patches


* [Locale
 Patch](http://cppcms.com/files/locale/boost_locale_utf.patch) - Fixes a bug which causes `boost::locale::utf::utf\_traits`
 to accept some invalid UTF-8 sequences, which is a possible security flaw.

### New Libraries


* [Container](/libs/container/index.html):
 Standard
 library containers and extensions, from Ion Gaztañaga.
* [Locale](/libs/locale/index.html):
 Provide localization
 and Unicode handling tools for C++, from Artyom Beilis.
* [Move](/doc/html/move.html):
 Portable move semantics
 for C++03 and C++11 compilers, from Ion Gaztañaga.

### Updated Libraries


* [Asio](/libs/asio/index.html):

	+ Implemented various performance improvements, including:
	 
		- Using thread-local operation queues in single-threaded use
		 cases (i.e. when `concurrency\_hint`
		 is 1) to eliminate a lock/unlock pair.
		- Allowing some `epoll\_reactor`
		 speculative operations to be performed without holding the
		 lock.
		- Improving locality of reference by performing an `epoll\_reactor`'s I/O operation
		 immediately before the corresponding handler is called. Also
		 improves scalability across CPUs.
		- Specialising asynchronous read and write operations for buffer
		 sequences that are arrays (`boost::array`
		 or `std::array`) of exactly two buffers.
	+ Fixed compile error in regex overload of `async\_read\_until`
	 ([#5688](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5688)).
	+ Fixed Windows-specific compile error by explicitly specifying the
	 `signal()`
	 function from the global namespace ([#5722](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5722)).
	+ Changed `deadline\_timer`
	 implementation to not read clock unless the timer heap is non-empty.
	+ Changed SSL buffer sizes to be large enough to hold a complete TLS
	 record ([#5854](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5854)).
	+ Fixed synchronous `null\_buffers`
	 operations so that they obey the user's non-blocking setting ([#5756](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5756)).
	+ Changed to set `fd\_set`
	 size at runtime when using Windows.
	+ Disabled MSVC warning due to const qualifier being applied to function
	 type.
	+ Fixed crash that occurs when using Intel C++ compiler ([#5763](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5763)).
	+ Changed OpenSSL initialisation to support all available algorithms.
	+ Fixed SSL error mapping when session is gracefully shut down.
	+ Added some latency test programs.
	+ Clarified that a read operation ends when the buffer is full ([#5999](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5999)).
	+ Fixed exception safety issue in `epoll\_reactor`
	 initialisation ([#6006](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6006)).
	+ Made number of strand implementations configurable via `BOOST\_ASIO\_STRAND\_IMPLEMENTATIONS`
	 macro.
	+ Added support for `BOOST\_ASIO\_ENABLE\_SEQUENTIAL\_STRAND\_ALLOCATION`
	 flag which switches strand allocation to use a round-robin approach
	 rather than hashing.
	+ Fixed potential strand starvation issue that can occur when `strand.post()`
	 is used.
* [Chrono](/libs/chrono/index.html):

	+ [#5979](http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5979)
	 Added chrono rounding utilities as defined by Howard Hinnant [here](http://home.roadrunner.com/~hinnant/duration_io/chrono_util.html).
	+ [#5978](http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5978)
	 Add BOOST\_CHRONO\_HAS\_PROCESS\_CLOCKS to know if process clocks are
	 available.
	+ [#5998](http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5998)
	 Make possible to disable hybrid error handling.
	+ [#5906](http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5906)
	 Take in account the constexpr as defined in the standard.
	+ [#5907](http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5907)
	 Take in account noexcept for compilers supporting it.
	+ Fixed some bugs.
	+ See the [History](/doc/html/chrono/appendices.html#chrono.appendices.history)
	 for more details.
* [Config](/libs/config/index.html):

	+ Add `BOOST\_NO\_DECLTYPE\_N3276`
	 config macro. (See [N3276](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3276.pdf).)
* [Fusion](/libs/fusion/index.html):

	+ Make `single\_view`
	 a random access fusion sequence.
	+ Remove bogus compile-time asserts from `fusion::distance`.
	+ Cleaner implementation of segmented Fusion.
* [Geometry](/libs/geometry):

	+ Bugfixes:
	 
		- Robustness issue, in some circumstances the union failed to
		 output. Fixed.
		- Robustness issue, in some circumstances the calculated intersection
		 point was outside the segment. Fixed.
		- Concept issue, cartesian intersect didn't understand segments
		 other than the provided one. Fixed.
		- Sometimes self-intersections in linestrings were missed. Fixed.
		- The fusion coordinate system was not registered correctly.
		 Fixed.
	+ Solved tickets:
	 
		- [#5726](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5726)
		 (Segment intersection algorithm still assumes 'first', 'second'
		 members)
		- [#5744](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5744)
		 (mistake fusion adapt example)
		- [#5748](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5748)
		 (need include <boost/foreach.hpp>)
		- [#5954](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5954)
		 (distance\_pythagoras skips sqrt() step)
	+ Improvements on algorithms:
	 
		- Checking self-intersections is now not done automatically,
		 this can blast performance.
		- Besides that, checking self-intersections is made faster.
		- Intersections now avoid outputting duplicate points. So they
		 output the minimal set.
	+ Additional algorithms:
	 
		- covered\_by: within is defined as "within, not on boundary".
		 covered\_by is "within or on boundary"
	+ Additional functionality:
	 
		- within: strategies can now be specified for within<point,
		 box> and within<box, box>
		- convert: a much broader range of conversions is supported
		- assign: idem, (currently partly) synonym for convert (but reversed
		 arguments)
	+ Additional coordinate types:
	 
		- Basic support for Boost.Rational
* [Graph](/libs/graph/):

	+ Fixed bugs [#5185](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5185),
	 [#5506](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5506),
	 [#5813](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5813)
	 and [#5919](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5919).
	+ Various other bug fixes not in Trac.
	+ Changed edge\_descriptor type for reverse\_graph to a new data type
	 to avoid ambiguities with the edge\_descriptor of the underlying graph.
* [Interprocess](/libs/interprocess/index.html):

	+ Fixed bugs [#2796](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2796),
	 [#4031](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4031),
	 [#4251](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4251),
	 [#4452](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4452),
	 [#4895](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4895),
	 [#5077](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5077),
	 [#5120](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5120),
	 [#5123](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5123),
	 [#5230](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5230),
	 [#5197](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5197),
	 [#5287](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5287),
	 [#5294](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5294),
	 [#5306](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5306),
	 [#5308](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5308),
	 [#5392](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5392),
	 [#5409](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5409),
	+ Added support to customize offset\_ptr and allow creating custom managed
	 segments that might be shared between 32 and 64 bit processes.
	+ Shared memory in windows has again filesystem lifetime: kernel bootstamp
	 and WMI use to get a reliable timestamp was causing a lot of trouble.
* [Intrusive](/libs/intrusive/index.html):

	+ Fixed bugs [#4797](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4797),
	 [#5165](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5165),
	 [#5183](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5183),
	 [#5191](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5191).
* [Lexical cast](/libs/conversion/lexical_cast.htm):

	+ Added code to work with Inf and NaN values on any platform ([#5689](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5689)).
	+ New Quickbook documentation ([#5723](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5723)).
	+ Better performance and less memory usage for many combinations of
	 Source and Target types.
	+ Better performance for C locale.
* [Math](/libs/math/index.html):

	+ Added new series evaluation methods to the cyclic Bessel I, J, K
	 and Y functions. Also taken great care to avoid spurious over and
	 underflow of these functions. Fixes issue [#5560](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5560).
	+ Added an example of using Inverse Chi-Squared distribution for Bayesian
	 statistics, provided by Thomas Mang.
	+ Added tests to use improved version of lexical\_cast which handles
	 C99 nonfinites without using global facets.
	+ Corrected wrong out-of-bound uniform distribution CDF complement
	 values [#5733](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5733).
	+ Enabled long double support on OpenBSD (issue [#6014](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6014)).
	+ Changed nextafter and related functions to behave in the same way
	 as other implementations - so that nextafter(+INF, 0) is a finite
	 value (issue [#5832](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5832)).
	+ Changed tuple include configuration to fix issue when using in conjunction
	 with Boost.Tr1 (issue [#5934](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5934)).
	+ Changed class eps\_tolerance to behave correctly when both ends of
	 the range are zero (issue [#6001](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6001)).
	+ Fixed missing include guards on prime.hpp (issue [#5927](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5927)).
	+ Removed unused/undocumented constants from constants.hpp (issue
	 [#5982](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5982)).
	+ Fixed missing std:: prefix in nonfinite\_num\_facets.hpp (issue [#5914](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5914)).
	+ Minor patches for Cray compiler compatibility.
* [MSM](/libs/msm/):

	+ eUML: added easier event reprocessing: process(event\_) and reprocess()
	+ Rewrite of internal transition tables. There were a few bugs (failing
	 recursivity in internal transition tables of sub-sub machines) and
	 a missing feature (unused internal transition table of the main state
	 machine).
	+ Bugfixes
	 
		- Reverted favor\_compile\_time policy to Boost 1.46 state
		- none event now is convertible from any other event
		- eUML and pseudo exit states
		- Fixed not working Flag\_AND
		- Fixed rare bugs causing multiple processing of the same event
		 in a submachine whose transition table contains this event
		 and a base event of it.
		- gcc warnings about unused variables
	+ Breaking change: the new internal transition table feature causes
	 a minor breaking change. In a submachine, the "Fsm" template
	 parameter for guards / actions of an internal table declared using
	 internal\_transition\_table now is the submachine, not the higher-level
	 state machine. Internal transitions declared using internal rows
	 in the higher-level state machine keep their behavior (the "Fsm"
	 parameter is the higher-level state machine). To sum up, the internal
	 transition "Fsm" parameter is the closest state machine
	 containing this transition.
* [Numeric.Conversion](/libs/numeric/conversion/index.html):

	+ Added numeric\_cast\_traits; see '[numeric\_cast\_traits](/doc/libs/1_48_0/libs/numeric/conversion/doc/html/boost_numericconversion/type_requirements_and_user_defined_types_support.html#boost_numericconversion.type_requirements_and_user_defined_types_support.udts_with_numeric_cast)'
	 for details.
* [Proto](/libs/proto/index.html):

	+ **Breaking Change:** Reduce numbers
	 of operator overloads by using rvalue references on compilers that
	 support them. Any user code that defines additional operator overloads
	 on Proto expressions could potentially be rendered ambiguous by this
	 change. The solution is to use a grammar to disable Proto's operators
	 that are made ambiguous by any user-defined operators.
	+ Move definitions of Proto tag types into an ADL-blocking namespace.
	+ Add second template parameter to `proto::siwtch\_`
	 to control dispatching to cases.
	+ Allow dependent domains to be specified with `BOOST\_PROTO\_EXTENDS`
	 and `BOOST\_PROTO\_BASIC\_EXTENDS`.
* [Regex](/libs/regex/):

	+ Fixed issues: [#698](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/698),
	 [#5835](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5835),
	 [#5958](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5958),
	 [#5736](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5736).
* [Spirit](/libs/spirit/index.html):

	+ Spirit V2.5.1, see the '[What's
	 New](/doc/libs/1_48_0/libs/spirit/doc/html/spirit/what_s_new/spirit_2_5_1.html)' section for details.
* [TypeTraits](/libs/type_traits/):

	+ Extension to support [operator
	 detection](/libs/type_traits/doc/html/boost_typetraits/category/value_traits/operators.html).
* [Unordered](/libs/unordered/):

	+ Improved support for the C++11 standard - breaking change to equality
	 and emplace.
	+ Use Boost.Move to implement move semantics.
	+ See the [change
	 log](/doc/html/unordered/changes.html#unordered.changes.boost_1_48_0___major_update) for full details.
* [Wave](/libs/wave/index.html):

	+ See the [Changelog](/libs/wave/ChangeLog) for details.
